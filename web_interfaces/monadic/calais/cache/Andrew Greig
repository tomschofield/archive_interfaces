His most recent poetry titles are Getting Higher: the complete mountain poems (Polygon, 2011) and Found at Sea (Polygon, 2013).Known as \u2018the poet laureate of climbing\u2019, he publishes his collected poems of mountain adventures real and metaphorical as Getting Higher with Birlinn in 2011. Two books on his Himalayan expeditions have become classics in their field, as have Preferred Lies (a meditation on golf, self-recovery, Scotland) and At the Loch of the Green Corrie (fishing for Norman MacCaig, catching much else besides). His seven novels include That Summer (Faber, 2000), The Return of John Macnab (Headline, 1996) and its late sequel Romanno Bridge (Quercus, 2008), In Another Light (Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2004), which was Saltire Scottish Book of the Year, and most recently, Fair Helen (Quercus, 2013). He lives in Edinburgh and Orkney with his wife, novelist Lesley Glaister.
