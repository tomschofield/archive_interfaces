Born in the Nova Scotia backwoods, Alden Nowlan left school at 12 and worked in a sawmill before becoming a local newspaper reporter. While working at the Observer, a newspaper in Hartland, New Brunswick, he began writing books of poetry. In 1967, he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship, and his collection Bread, Wine and Salt was awarded the Governor General's Award for Poetry. In 1966, he was diagnosed with throat cancer. His health forced him to give up his newspaper job, but at the same time the University of New Brunswick in Fredericton offered him the position of Writer-in-Residence. He remained in the position until his death on 27 June 1983.The appearance of his work in the Bloodaxe anthology Staying Alive helped to spread his popularity beyond Canada \u2013 to a British and Irish readership following the publication of the 2002 edition and then in 2003 to an American readership with Miramax's publication of the US edition. In 2004 Bloodaxe published Between Laughter and Tears as the first title in its Bloodaxe World Poets series.There have been two notable biographies of Alden Nowlan published in Canada, Patrick Toner's If I Could Turn and Meet Myself: The Life of Alden Nowlan (Goose Lane Editions, 2000) and Gregory M. Cook's One Heart, One Way: Alden Nowlan, A Writer's Life (Pottersfield Press, 2003). In 2006 Guernica editions published Alden Nowlan: Essays on His Works, edited by Gregory M. Cook. In 2009, Goose Lane Editions reissued his posthumously published autobiographical first novel, The Wanton Troopers (1988).
