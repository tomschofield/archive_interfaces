Finding both inspiration and provocation in the poetry of T. S. Eliot, Crane wrote modernist poetry that was difficult, highly stylized, and ambitious in its scope. In his most ambitious work, The Bridge, Crane sought to write an epic poem, in the vein of The Waste Land, that expressed a more optimistic view of modern, urban culture than the one that he found in Eliot's work. In the years following his suicide at the age of 32, Crane has been hailed by playwrights, poets, and literary critics alike (including Robert Lowell, Derek Walcott, Tennessee Williams, and Harold Bloom), as being one of the most influential poets of his generation.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2014-05-08 06:33:03.968"},"meta":{"contentType":"text/raw","emVer":"7.1.1103.5","langIdVer":"DefaultLangId","processingVer":"CalaisJob01","submissionDate":"2014-05-08 06:33:03.750","submitterCode":"5befa814-a279-7c61-eb84-e1dd1f7a393e","signature":"digestalg-1|wOxAFIntCFDgbTxg0/YoP8TqdPc=|XguM7qRby2WyJAXFsHpxSSm3KUpKqMHLy9bqKAb57R0OWKd5JqG+KQ==","language":"English"}},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/5a045cdc-c8ff-3518-801f-b2eea3c1270b/lid/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http://d.opencalais.com/lid/DefaultLangId/English"},"http://d.opencalais.com/pershash-1/903045c1-db2b-30e7-8073-0b3982553c52":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"Person","name":"Robert Lowell","persontype":"N/A","nationality":"N/A","commonname":"Robert Lowell","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/Person","instances":[{"detection":"[poets, and literary critics alike (including ]Robert Lowell[, Derek Walcott, Tennessee Williams, and Harold]","prefix":"poets, and literary critics alike (including ","exact":"Robert Lowell","suffix":", Derek Walcott, Tennessee Williams, and Harold","offset":588,"length":13}],"relevance":0.141},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/ebb0a6ac-92fc-359c-8502-dce14e312553":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"Position","name":"poet","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/Position","instances":[{"detection":"[ (July 21, 1899 \u2013 April 27, 1932) was an American ]poet[.
