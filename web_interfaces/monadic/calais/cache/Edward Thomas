He grew up in London, but developed a passion for Nature. Hating the economic forces that had destroyed agricultural communities and expanded cities, Thomas absorbed, as his poetry shows, the literary and folk traditions of the English countryside.After studying history at Oxford, he lived in rural southern England, particularly Steep in Hampshire. He supported his family by writing reviews, country books, biography and criticism. Overwork caused (sometimes suicidal) depression and creative despair. This self-styled \u2018hurried & harried prose man\u2019 could not find a \u2018form that suits me\u2019. Yet books such as The South Country (1909) and In Pursuit of Spring (1914) fertilised the poetry which \u2013 prompted by Robert Frost \u2013 Thomas began to write in December 1914. An influential poetry-reviewer, Thomas had praised Frost\u2019s North of Boston as \u2018revolutionary\u2019. And its \u2018absolute fidelity to the postures which the voice assumes in the most expressive intimate speech\u2019 clarified his own artistic direction. Thomas's poem \u2018The sun used to shine\u2019 celebrates the poets\u2019 friendship, but also suggests Thomas\u2019s darker inspiration \u2013 the Great War. Although over-age, he enlisted in the Artists\u2019 Rifles (July 1915). He was killed at Arras (April 1917) before his first collection, Poems, appeared. Edna Longley's edition of his poetry, The Annotated Collected Poems (Bloodaxe Books, 2008), has established the most authoritative text of his work, and has the most comprehensive notes and critical apparatus of any edition.
