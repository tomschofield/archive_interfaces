She was one of the finest poetry readers this country produced, possessing a rare ability to hear a poem and become its voice. She published four collections of poems, including Water Over Stone (Enitharmon Press, 1980) and Snow Light, Water Light (Bloodaxe Books, 1983). She died in 1983, aged 45, after a long illness. Her Collected Poems (1985) was edited by her husband, the poet and critic Roger Garfitt, with a new edition issued in 2011 with an audio CD of her reading her work included.
