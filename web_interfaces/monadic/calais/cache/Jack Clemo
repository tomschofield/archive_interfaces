He was also stone deaf, and after writing two visionary novels and his autobiographical Confession of a Rebel, he lost his sight in 1955. His Selected Poems (1988) and Approach to Murano (1993) show the development of his poetry from a puritanical anti-nature stance to a later, mellower outlook. The Cured Arno is his last collection, which he had only just completed at the time of his death in 1994.","docTitle":"","docDate":"2014-05-08 06:42:51.223"},"meta":{"contentType":"text/raw","emVer":"7.1.1103.5","langIdVer":"DefaultLangId","processingVer":"CalaisJob01","submissionDate":"2014-05-08 06:42:51.004","submitterCode":"5befa814-a279-7c61-eb84-e1dd1f7a393e","signature":"digestalg-1|IcwNAZ5TQ+IMaJh5oeagsUpEOz4=|USYZrbGvcWDtZCBCqKH08DoJ2kQCofLMXeiYJIgJnG766AfRBV1iPA==","language":"English"}},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/2a0d9018-6084-335b-9597-3716e30be936/cat/1":{"_typeGroup":"topics","category":"http://d.opencalais.com/cat/Calais/War_Conflict","classifierName":"Calais","categoryName":"War_Conflict","score":0.569},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/2a0d9018-6084-335b-9597-3716e30be936/lid/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http://d.opencalais.com/lid/DefaultLangId/English"},"http://d.opencalais.com/pershash-1/630da1cf-8be9-3c0a-a8d2-df2c11204eac":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"Person","name":"Jack Clemo","persontype":"N/A","nationality":"N/A","commonname":"Jack Clemo","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/Person","instances":[{"detection":"[As a young man, ]Jack Clemo[ lived in poverty amidst the bleak clay]","prefix":"As a young man, ","exact":"Jack Clemo","suffix":" lived in poverty amidst the bleak clay","offset":16,"length":10},{"detection":"[amidst the bleak clay wastelands of Cornwall. ]He[ was also stone deaf, and after writing two]","prefix":"amidst the bleak clay wastelands of Cornwall.
