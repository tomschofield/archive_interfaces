He lives and works in London. His first book-length collection, The Man in the White Suit (Bloodaxe Books, 1999), was a Poetry Book Society Recommendation, won the Forward Prize for Best First Collection in 1999, and was selected for the Next Generation Poets promotion in 2004. From The Word Go was published by Bloodaxe Books in 2007. His most recent projects include a stage adaptation of Philippe Petit\u2019s To Reach the Cloud; the screenplay for the Australian film Romulus, My Father, starring Eric Bana, which won Best Film at the Australian Film Awards; Success, a play for the National Theatre's Connections project; and a trilogy of historical novels (Nefertiti, shortlisted for CWA Best Historical Crime Novel, Tutankhamun and Egypt: The Book of Chaos which Mammoth Screen are developing for TV). He is a screenwriter, and is also working the composer Tansy Davies and director Deborah Warner on an opera for ENO. In September 2010 he was invited to join Cape Farewell's trip to the Arctic to explore climate change, and from that journey arose a commission from United Visual Artists to create poems and texts for their ground-breaking installation High Arctic at the National Maritime Museum (2011). Those poems, together with others inspired by the Arctic and its voices, are gathered in his collection The Farewell Glacier (Bloodaxe Books, 2012).","docTitle":"","docDate":"2014-05-08 07:44:06.496"},"meta":{"contentType":"text/raw","emVer":"7.1.1103.5","langIdVer":"DefaultLangId","processingVer":"CalaisJob01","submissionDate":"2014-05-08 07:44:05.981","submitterCode":"5befa814-a279-7c61-eb84-e1dd1f7a393e","signature":"digestalg-1|cmL8LMB6dzwa44FQ0YXtKLF6jrE=|RptDqyNF+3iRnxZlBQyaEjwbUBkf5BRt0G5lNBAMqkmbxyXb3hR0KQ==","language":"English"}},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/97a1ce77-590d-355c-991c-f4a41b7b9a0e/cat/1":{"_typeGroup":"topics","category":"http://d.opencalais.com/cat/Calais/Entertainment_Culture","classifierName":"Calais","categoryName":"Entertainment_Culture","score":1},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/97a1ce77-590d-355c-991c-f4a41b7b9a0e/cat/2":{"_typeGroup":"topics","category":"http://d.opencalais.com/cat/Calais/HumanInterest","classifierName":"Calais","categoryName":"Human Interest","score":0.928},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/97a1ce77-590d-355c-991c-f4a41b7b9a0e/lid/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http://d.opencalais.com/lid/DefaultLangId/English"},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/f391ff53-8640-3d85-a115-6c1ba67cb29e":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"Facility","name":"National Maritime Museum","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/Facility","instances":[{"detection":"[ground-breaking installation High Arctic at the ]National Maritime Museum[ (2011).
