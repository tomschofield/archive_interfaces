She was born in New York City and grew up in Washington, DC. She is a poet, essayist, playwright, teacher and scholar of African-American literature and culture, and has given readings and lectures on African-American literature and culture in many countries. She has published four collections in the States: The Venus Hottentot (1990), Body of Life (1996), Antebellum Dream Book (2001) and American Sublime (2005), as well as a collection of essays on African American artistic life through literature, painting, film and popular media, The Black Interior (Graywolf, 2004). Her first British publication, American Blue: Selected Poems 2006), draws on all these. The anthology Bloodaxe Poetry Introductions: 1 (2006) includes a selection of her poems with extracts from an interview and an essay on African American poetry. Miss Crandall's School for Young Ladies & Little Misses of Color, a collaboration with poet Marilyn Nelson and artist Floyd Cooper, was published by Worksong in 2007. She has been filmed reading a selection of her work for the DVD-anthology In Person: 30 Poets (Bloodaxe, 2008). Elizabeth Alexander lives in New Haven, Connecticut, and is Professor of African-American Studies at Yale University. In January 2009 she read the inaugural poem for the swearing-in of President Barack Obama.
