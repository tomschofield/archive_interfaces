He was ordained into the Triratna Buddhist Order in 1990 and given the name Maitreyabandhu. Since then he has lived and worked at the LBC, teaching Buddhism and meditation. He has written two books on Buddhism, Thicker than Blood: Friendship on the Buddhist Path (2001) and Life with Full Attention: a Practical Course in Mindfulness (2009), both with Windhorse Publications. His forthcoming book, The Journey and the Guide, also with Windhorse, is due in 2014. In 2010 he founded Poetry East, a poetry venue exploring the relationship between spiritual life and poetry, and attracting many of Britain's foremost poets, including Jo Shapcott, David Constantine, Don Paterson and Sean O\u2019Brien.Maitreyabandhu has won the Keats-Shelley Prize, the Basil Bunting Award, the Geoffrey Dearmer Prize, and the Ledbury Festival Poetry Competition.
