He married Laura Stinson and returned to Northern Ireland to teach at Friends' School Lisburn for five years. His final foreign excursion was a position at Ahmadu Bello University in Nigeria, where he worked for three years. During this time they had five children: Rachel, Sarah, Adam, Helen and Penelope. He returned to Northern Ireland in 1968, accepting a position at the recently-opened New University of Ulster in Coleraine, where he remained until his retirement in 1984.During the early '70s - the bloodiest times of all in NI - he was the inspiration and leading light for The Resistance Cabaret, a satirical revue combining song, poetry and political comment on 'the troubles' and life in general, written and performed by Simmons and some of his students. Arguably, Simmons - whose passion for poetry was equalled only by his yearning to make it accessible to all the people - felt most at home in this setting, connecting with an audience that was moved to talk back.Near the end of his teaching career at the University of Ulster, Simmons and his first wife Laura divorced. He married Imelda Foley[citation needed], the sister of Derry poet and fiction writer Michael Foley, and had one child, Anna. After this marriage to Imelda ended, he had a son Ben with his third wife, fellow-poet Janice Fitzpatrick. Simmons and Fitzpatrick started The Poets' House, initially in Islandmagee in County Antrim, later in Falcarragh in County Donegal.
