I shall sleep, and without dreams. Then one day, perhaps a hundred thousand years from now, I shall find myself in a new body, meeting those who have been chosen to be my guardians.... At first I will know nothing of Diaspar and will have no memories of what I was before. Those memories will slowly return, at the end of my infancy, and I will build upon them as I move forward into my newcycleofexistence.\u2019Arthur C. Clarke :TheCityandtheStars Missing his noisyplay around the house, and remembering the time was no doubt near, she hurried out, unkempt as she was, andfound him at last, pale-faced and tearstained, hunched on the weir bank - no fishing-rod in sight - plunged in himself, hispain. With a motherly tenderness she wiped his eyes with her skirt-hem; she knew; she gently questioned him; and said: Believe me, dear, though it will seem strange to you, I have wept too for all these things you mention - and others that may  be have not yet started to haunt you again. Do you recall, for instance, the dark coppery flowers on the low trees ? the waterfalls, or methane-falls - call them what you like - leaping off cliffs ? the strong, live winds, and violet sky flashing with great clouds ? And I expect you have walked many a time with your husband on those mountain-slopes as bright - 114- \n￼D. M. THOMAS as metal, with thunder laughing in the ground, and clear red flame exploding above you? I know I have - though with, as it happens, a wife beside me - a dear woman. ... I too have been there, Jeserac; a terribly long time ago, but it\u2019s still precious to me. Today isn\u2019t the time to convince you that these eroded hills, blue sky, green woods, not to mention the speckled fish you like catching, are themselves not unbeautiful. . . this first day, you\u2019ve a right to feel desperate. I recall myself (though how many others in between 1) writhing in the ammonia- snow I\u2019d always thought of as home, and was to again - tormented by the globe your mind is filled with, shrieking at my sisters to leave me in peace 1Poor mites, they ran off and told everyone that ayarn was inside me 1- This, darling, was near Procyon, the light your father taught you to find last night. - Oh, don\u2019t think I don\u2019t understand; it\u2019s the beings you gave yourself in love to - not moons or cliffsIAnd the dull ache of this you must expect never to wholly leave you. How often one finds oneself wondering - and the worst of it\u2019s being completely unable to share your dark thoughts with anyone else - where is, say, Kersti ? - a granddaughter -115- r \n￼PENGUIN MODERN POETS II I once had somewhere in Bootes; in which of the far-flung micro-files of our cosmic city Diaspar is that beloved pattern crystallized; and where will she - or he - emerge again ? Yet one knows there can be no answer. Only the dumb Selector knows that. Still, it\u2019s the way of Hera\u2019s Spring; we have to count our blessings. - I see that too hasn\u2019t come back yet, dearl It would soon, so I may as well remind you. Ages and ages ago, on this very planet (in re-emerging here, we\u2019ve come home, in the deepest sense), men, who had previously \u2018died\u2019, as though they were cattle or sheep, found out the secret of immortality. . . . Still doesn\u2019t bring it back? - Just vaguely\\ Well, anyway, after they\u2019d finished rejoicing, they found that, after all, the threatening shears were things they couldn\u2019t do without. It\u2019s said the daffodils withered in the poets\u2019 verses; nothing seemed beautiful when nothing would pass away I - in fact, they found the prospects so deadly they clamoured for death to be restored. Instead, their scientists thought up a middle way, called Hera\u2019s Spring, (I don\u2019t know who gave it that name). But it came from the way Hera, \u2018queen of the heavens \u2019 (you\u2019ve heard of her in this world) renewed her virginity, - 116- \n￼BBSS D. M. THOMAS that is her purity, each year, by bathing in the spring of Canathos. It fits. The spring we step into is the frozen heart of a crystal, from which we emerge, having just held our breaths, maybe a million years later. This first time is the worst, Jeserac dear - your homesickness, if you like, is focused, not radiated. When you have had, like me, almost as many parents alone as there are stars out on these sharp, moonless nights - in fact, when I look up, to whatever point in the sky, I know I\u2019ll face a dozen able to pierce through me, hazy or bright, each with a dozen bereavements - you\u2019ll find the ache is a thing you can\u2019t do without either, in some queer way. ... But here I am, talking as if I\u2019m antique, instead of being quite a youngster in the city, not all that much older or wiser than your small brother Helderr, whose first world this isI- and who, if I know anything, has woken up howling for my milk by this time! You stay here, Jeserac; come home to us when you feel ready, or hungry! -117- \n￼POMEGRANATE Each year more clearly you can see her dark flowers wither to the sick light, or crush to our tighter embrace, as she picks up her bag and her coat, drifts out to face the statutory six-months with her mother. She turns to my heart\u2019s cog; rounded, no longer the child the courts shared between us, as a pomegranate cleft: small need any more for the fury who would have left me nothing . . . though god knows I have never reviled her. \u2018Be good to her,\u2019 I say, this morning; \u2018give her my \u2014 \u2019 (I cannot finish). \u2018And \u2014 forget me while you\u2019re there.\u2019 \u2018You both say that!\u2019 She flicks her eyes . . . \u2018Father, must I go?\u2019 My green shoot, Kore, dawdles now at the brightening river\u2019s ferry \u2014 waves once \u2014 head bent, March uncabling her hair \u2014 then shoulders her bag, full of books I\u2019ll expect her to know. \n￼r \n￼CYGNUS A Removing hairgrips, nail-varnish, pensively brushing Black hair down to the black Bra, scattering a thick perfume on the night, You've time to read me pointed texts From the Gideons\u2019 Bible propped by the red-stained kleenex Till I must shut my eyes tight While you slip Off (still that ludicrous reserve) Your diaphanous half-slip.

Twenty eight adults and 116 children were killed: a generation. The marginal prose-passages are from \u2018Aberfan'. a book by Tony Austin, and from a B.B.C. television documentary. REQUIEM FOR ABERFAN \n￼\u2018The scenery to the south . . . became surprisingly beautiful. . . noble mountains met the view, green I Magnates whose sweated legions crucified The valleys, washed their soft white hands, although The children died before they died. Brethren who rode their God in on the tide Of weeping, hawk this good comfort, that we owe Our deaths to One on green hill crucified. The child whose dream, the child whose drawing tried To tell somebody that the hill would flow, Knew that they died before they died. Workmen who chose and staked this mountainside, Their ankles lush with streams, a school below, Learn on what green hill they were crucified. Sleepers who from their sheets saw the coal slide And bury, seven nights before it happened, know The children died before they died. Mothers, whose olf-to-death sharp voices denied Fevers and fancies, following at each cock-crow The road they drove them to be crucified, Die on the ninth-hour before they died. fields and majestic woods.' \u2014 George Borrow. \u2018I dreamt I went to school and there was no school there. Something black had come all overit.\u2019-\u2014 A victim, the day before Aberfan. \u2018Mountains of coal and water were rushing down upon the valley, burying the building. The screams of those children were so vivid I screamed myself\u2014 -4Kent woman\u2019s dream. \n￼Councillor Jim Williams remembering how he said just before October 21 that he hoped Bethania Chapel would soon befull. Bethania (the chapel used as a mortuary) \u2018Soon, Lord, soon may I see it full.\u2019 A child to each pew, to work His will, And the gallery opened as an overspill. When Christ rode in to Bethany. The man He killed as God above He chose to raise, in human love. Comeforth, He said, and the linens moved. When Christ rode in to Bethany. F for Female, M for Male, \u2018Not to be opened\u2019, like Christmas mail: Had these women, searching, anointed Him with oil, Would Christ have come to Bethania? Would He have raced, with police-escort, Up the jammed trunk-road, to avert The stink of death that had four hours\u2019 start, Two thousand years after Bethany? Cramped in a valley, Aberfan. Manmade black hills roadblock the sun. Only embalmers, in Capel Aberfan, Make miracles out of Bethania. In two\u2019s, they queue at the door through the night, Dazed, unspeaking. A crude flashlight Gets smashed by a stone as its stare insults, No light like His at Bethany. He spoke; and the corpse resumed its ghost. Only churning lorries, piled with waste, And ambulances, processing without haste, Have cracked and emptied Bethania. Letters to indicate the barest details were chalked at the ends of the pews . . . The \u2018Not to be opened\u2019 notes were ignored because cause of death had to be confirmed and identity established. Once there had been identification coffins were taken to Capel Aberfan. Here a team of embalmers worked. The old building was not to be used again in the coming months; its foundations were too shaken by the traffic. \n￼There was no keeping out, that day, or keeping in Either. They set up roadblocks, but you couldn\u2019t stop All Britain pitching in and trying to help. Or gawp. I stopped one car myself, a whole family, From the Midlands, \u2018Is this the place where all those kids Are buried?\u2019he said. But mostly they wanted to help, Anything they could do. Which wasn\u2019t much. They didn\u2019t have a chance, you see, didn\u2019t have a chance.. . Yet, you couldn\u2019t seem to keep them in. The children. Not all that lot could. My missus and me, we saw David A score of times, I suppose, that Friday. He was everywhere! Running up to the front-door, about to bang it shut, About to turn the corner. Always about to, always three of us, In the road, in the crowd. Once, I still swear I did see him, In Moy Road, then he vanished. There were the rumours, you see, Of some being found alive. The whole terrace was like that, Full of them. No, you couldn\u2019t shut them in. It was like Holes in the slurry you couldn\u2019t see. There were More kids about the place than normal, I\u2019d say. Funny, it was the same even when I\u2019d found David In Betliania. Not a mark on him, there wasn\u2019t. Like a doll. We still hoped. It hadn\u2019t happened, do you know? \n￼if The Father The day you came, I felt her turn from me. Absence, fullbreasted, coasting at my side, Straining for different hungers \u2014 rightfully. With no regrets, my pit-black spirit died And rose like waste through galleries of you. Cast like a tip, I saw and sang my pride, The first-born, inexhaustible, the new Seam, richer, deeper than all Rhondda. A man Gets bora again out of his wife, I knew, What did it matter that the more you ran Into your mother\u2019s heart, the closer I felt To an eighth spewed cone outtopping Aberfan? With no regrets. And yet have I not knelt Begging God that His curse should overwhelm Me also, so confirmed was I in guilt At having willed this on you, in some dream I had forgotten maybe. When, as the arc- Lights flickered on the ant-hill, I heard your scream Rise faintly from a desk, miles deep, the black Slurry was in myself. Why did we pause? Now, when the shuddering cage transports us back To that rise up to hell \u2014 untold, we knew \u2014 Always I hear, faintly, unreachably, You cry where my own evil fell on you. Breaths held in, ears strained for a faint murmur that would lead to a life saved. Silence . . . the whistle again, digging resumed. Deputies and over  men kept the few details to themselves. They did not want panic. There was none, but no man came to the surface without knowing why. There are no secrets underground. IV \np ￼He dreams of his elder brother having parties in the grave. \u201c Robert, Robert, play with me. You can win.\u201d Last night, in my sleep, I heard it. I was in disgrace for telling on them, but I didn\u2019t. Robert called me, Sissy. The Brother I steal into his room, with my pack of cards, And plays patience under his photo, Hoping to tempt him. I get tired of it. It never comes out. So I go to the mountain, quite a lot. I remember we had a story once About how somebody led these children into the V And there was a lame boy who couldn\u2019t go. mountain, Mummy doesn\u2019t know, but they have parties in the grave. The terrace is empty. All summer it\u2019s Sunday. If I showed him my cards, offered to let him win Only so he would play with me, play, Would he let me in? \n￼Diane could move her head now; she turned, saw the child who sat next to her. She screamed: \u201cThat\u2019s my sister.\u201d \u201cNo, dear, it\u2019s a I should have seen her. I might accept it, resign Myself to having lost her. Not now. You can\u2019t Send your child off to school at nine O\u2019clock and never see her again. You can\u2019t! They wouldn\u2019t let me into Bethania, where They had taken her. I should have fought my way in. They seemed to think I wouldn\u2019t be able to bear It. The condition she was in. dolly.\" Dr Oliver threw a blanket over the dolly. Diane went quiet. Because of that, she lives. I put flowers On her grave like the rest, every day, but she\u2019s not there, Not to me she isn\u2019t. It has blue eyes like hers \u2014 Look how they open. To me, she\u2019s there, Shut inside the doll. It was her best doll. I say Try, darling, try to move Your arms and legs for me, try. But it\u2019s all That stuff, surrounding, binding. She never moves. But I can see her struggling. It\u2019s such a shame, All that blackness round them . . . Sometimes her eyes Flinch open up at me as though I\u2019ll blame Her for not escaping. As though her eyes Can see me, either! But there is always hope That one day . . . And so I keep the room Exactly as she left it \u2014 her books, her skipping-rope, Her nightclothes. Suppose she woke to a strange room? People don\u2019t like it. Callers say I should free Myself from the past, that I must forget. My freedom\u2019s here in this room. She grew from me: Who would remember her if I forgot? \n￼Settle? Ah no! a butterfly, a cabbage-white. Earth trapped our shadows also as we leant Over the sllt-trench. Bodies saw them die. Yet when we drifted down the path VII The Tree June. A pallid cloud-drift of sun. Tree, where a year ago she swung, Branch and ropes holding the deepening brunt, Tree, where seven years ago we forked the afterbirth Forked it under, watched it grow. We tried to please, But there\u2019s little enough you could give, to child or tree, In Aberfan. Watch how coaldust blackens and defeats In two days the cherry blossom, too late for Easter. By what trick of its branches\u2019 shadow and light Do I look from the window and see thin limbs flash high? By what trick of time do I glimpse a torn leaf rise, V III Committal \u2014 Buoyed up breathless, half-conscious, by communal loss, Our bodies stayed behind, our shadows went. As if lifted off our feet by a great crowd Out of Cardiff Arms Park \u2014 under. \n￼The third, week of October 1966 was notablefor high winds and heavy rain. Parents needed to have children near. Mothers slept with daughters and fathers with sons. Normal marital relations were interrupted. The Quickening The year turns, to the eve. She lies awake. Once more the storm comes slanting out of the west. The younger girl is breathing by her side. Even so, that night, black drops had slashed the pane. She flinches; at this hour her child had cried Out in her sleep, but she has calmed her fears. She hears the tip upbristling, stormed awake. Silently, she rises. There are fears Of rain the spirit in the doll cannot Express. She crosses the dim passageway, To comfort it. But it is cold! so trapped! She bears it downstairs, opens the door, to lay Her burden in the fury of the storm. Crying, the storm lacerates her tears. She mounts. And goes this time into his room. She melts into his dream of wind and rain. She hears the loud drops guttering from the eaves Upon the lonely doll, running the stiff wax, Releasing limbs beflagged with torn wet leaves, And as the rain drums on, the quickening breach, She feels her child\u2019s return within her womb.
