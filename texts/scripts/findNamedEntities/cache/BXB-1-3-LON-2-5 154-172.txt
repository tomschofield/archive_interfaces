M uldoon\u2019s poem \u2018Cuba\u2019 makes this link, together with an Irish-American political connection. A father telling off his daughter for \u2018Running out to dances in next to nothing\u2019 goes on: \u2018Those Yankees were touch and go as it was - If you\u2019d heard Patton in Armagh - But this Kennedy\u2019s nearly an Irishman So he\u2019s not much better than ourselves. And him with only to say the word. If you\u2019ve got anything on your mind Maybe you should make your peace with God.\u201917 In the last stanza the girl confesses \u2018Bless me, Father, for I have sinned\u2019. But the poem in fact exposes the sins of fathers, men laying down the law} controlling women and taking up arms. Fathers in Northern Irish literature calibrate tradition and tran  sition, small shifts in the land of \u2018Not an Inch\u2019. Muldoon calls it \u2018writing about what is immediately in front of me, or immediately over my shoulder\u2019.18 If I now concentrate chiefly upon poetic fathers, it is because poetry more radically transmutes the autobio  graphical into the symbolic, looks further round the corner of the status quo. The actual fathers of poets include the following mixed bag: a Belfast shipyard worker, a South Derry cattle-dealer and small farmer, a Brooklyn exile, a market-gardener in Armagh orchard- country, a headmaster, and an English furniture salesman who fought in both world wars. The generation gaps span movements from country to city, from country to country, and in all but one case to a university education never achieved by the father. Brian Friel\u2019s drama has close associations with poetry, and the fathers in his plays since 1969 represent one pole of perception. In Aristocrats and Translations they personify the inadequacy of what the past has transmitted. The \u2018aristocratic\u2019 O\u2019Donnells of Ballybeg Hall are described, with Friel\u2019s evident sanction, as: four generations of a great Irish Catholic legal dynasty...a family with  out passion, without loyalty, without commitments; administering the law for anyone who happened to be in power; above all wars and famines and civil strife and political upheaval; ignored by its Protestant counter  parts, isolated from the mere Irish...15 Symbolically maimed by a stroke, the current head of the house focuses the play\u2019s attack on collaborationist, Redmondite, West British \n￼Longley 150-172 4/5/94 11:32 am Page \u2018WHEN DID YOU LAST SEE YOUR FATHER?\u2019 155 traditions in Irish politics. (Oddly, Aristocrats is usually interpreted as an exercise in Chekhovian melancholia.) Hugh, the hedge-school  master father in Translations, is more positively conceived. From the historical moment preceding the O\u2019Donnells\u2019 amoral deracination, he hands on authentic qualities and traditions of \u2018the mere Irish\u2019. Nevertheless, the play criticises his pandering to colonialist expecta  tions about the drunken, verbalising Irishman, who speaks a \u2018language ...full of the mythologies of fantasy and hope and self-deception\u2019.20 Hugh\u2019s son Owen, once a literal and metaphorical \u2018collaborator\u2019 in the Ordnance Survey of Ireland (begun in the 1820s), finally rejects his own compromises and his father\u2019s \u2018confusion\u2019,21when the British soldiers threaten the community. In both these plays the sense of weak fathers having let down their children makes a political comment on the history of Northern Catholics since 1921. This may be why Friel misrepresents the Ordnance Survey as an imposed Anglicisation, rather than as an effort - supervised by the best Gaelic scholars - to standardise the orthography of Gaelic place-names. (j.H. Andrews, historian of the Ordnance Survey, has recently castigated \u2018the credulity shown by serious scholars in swallowing Translations as a record of historical truth or at any rate historical probability\u2019. 22) The work of three poets from Protestant backgrounds situates the father with reference to rejection, reinvention, dislocation. Derek Mahon\u2019s poetry takes as its premi^ even its sine qua non, alienation from familial and tribal origins. In \u2018Ecclesiastes\u2019, which satirises the Protestant religious and political will to domination, the speaker resists blood-calls to \u2018nourish a fierce zeal\u2019 and love the January rains when they darken the dark doors and sink hard into the Antrim hills, the bog meadows, the heaped graves of your fathers.\u201d \u2018Fathers\u2019, with its biblical ring, is a common Protestant word for ancestry and history. John Hewitt\u2019s best-known poem, \u2018Once Alien Here\u2019, begins \u2018Once alien here my fathers built their house\u2019, and Mahon\u2019s \u2018Canadian Pacific\u2019 evokes Ulster-Scots and Scots noncon  formist emigrants to the new world as \u2018Those gaunt forefathers\u2019. Mahon has written no poem based on his actual father; but his early poems about anarchic male relatives - \u2018Grandfather\u2019 and \u2018Wicked Uncle\u2019 - imply a son\u2019s revolt by subverting \u2018adult\u2019 bourgeois Prot  estant respectability.His patriarchal poles seem to be the wrathful father and the renegade. Tom Paulin\u2019s Liberty Tree (1983) attacks Protestant culture in more narrowly political terms: Protestantism as Unionism. In \u2018Father \n￼Longley 150-172 4/5/94 11:32 am Page 156 \u2018WHEN DID YOU LAST SEE YOUR FATHER?\u2019 of History\u2019 he seems to invent an ideal forebear, a schoolmaster who builds Lisburn like a warm plain-spoken sermon on the rights of man. A sunned Antrim face, he maybe prays to the New Light in a relished dialect... z< Certainly a sunnier Antrim than Mahon\u2019s. This prelapsarian vision of the Protestant United Irishmen who should have begotten history, names the specific Republican fathers of its attitudes: \u2018Munro, Hope, Porter and McCracken.\u2019 In Michael Longley\u2019s poetry the father focuses questions of belonging rather than longing: an Englishman who fought twice for his country. The poem \u2018Second Sight\u201925imagines a disorienting visit to London during which the speaker asks: \u2018Where is my father\u2019s house, where my father?\u2019, what of an English dimension in Ireland, an Irish dimension in England? There is a contrast between two poems about the father\u2019s war-service written before and after 1969. The earlier, \u2018In Memoriam\u2019,26 sets out to \u2018read\u2019the father\u2019s personal \u2018history\u2019 as a means of comprehending the\u2018death andnightmare\u2019 of the Great War. The later poem, \u2018Wounds\u2019,27 uses the father\u2019s witness of the war - \u2018the Ulster Division at the Somme/Going over the top with \u201cFuck the Pope!\u201d/ \u201cNo surrender!\u201d \u2019 - as a perspective on civil war in Ulster, on the still more quintessential futility of deaths such as a bus-conductor shot through the head By a shivering boy who wandered in Before they could turn the television down Or tidy away the supper dishes. To the children, to a bewildered wife, I think \u2018Sorry Missus\u2019 was what he said. Paul Fussell comments: \u2018the irony always associated with the Somme attack remains to shade that conclusion. But at least the Somme attack had some swank and style: one could almost admire, if after  ward one had to deplore.\u201928 To digress briefly from fathers: the Somme occupies the imagin  ations of Longley, Martin, Leitch (Barbour Brown reflects: \u2018So many of his friends\u2019 names in the Deaths column of The Ballymena Observer')TM McGuinness. The latter, who comes from Donegal, is unique in approaching the theme from a background supposedly alien. More commonly, the world wars divide imaginations, if more subtly than the way Remembrance Day every November divides Dublin. Denial of any Catholic Irish participation in the wars \n￼\u2018WHEN DID YOU LAST SEE YOUR FATHER?\u2019 157 resembles the cultural suppression that obliges Paulin\u2019s Protestant United Irishmen to \u2018endure posterity without a monument\u2019. By a nice paradox, Stewart Parker\u2019s play about McCracken, Northern Star (1984), attracted Belfast audiences as much as Observe the Sons o f Ulster drew Dublin. This may help to change something, if not any results. However, Seamus Heaney\u2019s poem \u2018In Memoriam Francis Ledwidge\u201930finds this Irish Catholic\u2019s involvement in the war imagin  atively unresolvable, although the theme clearly compels him. Where  as for Longley the English \u2018soldier-poets\u2019 such as Isaac Rosenberg and Edward Thomas are declared literary-historical touchstones, Heaney\u2019s \u2018In Memoriam\u2019 regrets: \u2018In you, our dead enigma, all the strains/Criss-cross in useless equilibrium\u2019 (\u2018strains\u2019 puns on another genetic definition of history). Nevertheless, the poem\u2019s own blood  line includes one trope of First World War poetry, the haunting rural flashback, in the beautiful image: \u2018Ghosting the trenches with a bloom of hawthorn\u2019. Other elegies by Heaney recall Wilfred Owen. In telling Ledwidge, \u2018You were not keyed or pitched like these true-blue ones\u2019, which may impute undue patriotism to the British dead (\u2018True Blue\u2019 figures on Orange banners), manifests a deep Northern assumption about tribal inheritance. John Montague\u2019s The Rough Field is grounded on such assumptions. \u2018The Cage\u201931 introduces the poet\u2019s father as \u2018My father, the least happy man I have known\u2019 and also refers to \u2018the lost years in Brooklyn\u2019. \u2018Molly Bawn\u2019, in The Dead Kingdom (1984) still more explicitly places the father in the context of \u2018the embittered diaspora of/dispossessed Northern Republicans\u2019. The next poem, \u2018A Muddy Cup\u2019, explores the poet\u2019s separation as a child, not only from his father, but from his mother who gave him to be fostered. This family \u2018diaspora\u2019, echoing in the repeated adjective \u2018lost\u2019, both underlies and under  lines the historical losses mourned by The Rough Field: \u2018shards of a lost tradition\u2019; a dead Gaelic civilisation; the vanished, vanquished O\u2019Neills; the Flight of the Earls; the \u2018Loss\u2019 column of the New Omagh Road balance sheet; \u2018Our finally lost dream of man at home/ in a rural setting.\u2019 Montague\u2019s Tyrone terrain shows how local as well as family history influences the shape of the past in a poet\u2019s imagination. Local historical societies are much thicker on the ground in the North than in the South, perhaps for obvious territorial reasons: every Northerner is an amateur local historian. Barbour Brown\u2019s obsessive researches into his \u2018Valley\u2019 parallel Leitch\u2019s own curiosity. Brown progresses from church records to \u2018lists of rocks and plants and buildings\u2019 to a voyeuristic interest in \u2018the forked animal again\u2019, thus \n￼Longley 150-172 4/5/94 11:33 am Page 158 'WHEN DID YOU LAST SEE YOUR FATHER?\u2019 becoming \u2018this spy creeping about the hedgerows\u2019.32Similarly, Paul Muldoon\u2019s poetry can be read as alternative, transgressive parish- history. Seamus Heaney presents South Derry as a lusher field than Montague\u2019s Tyrone, and as the product of more complex geographical and historical co-ordinates. \u2018Terminus\u2019, from the pamphlet Hailstones (1984), ends on a vista of less than total loss: Baronies, parishes met where I was born. When I stood on the central stepping stone I was the last earl on horseback in midstream Still parleying, in earshot of his kernes.33 Heaney\u2019s midpoint \u2018parleying\u2019 gives rise to more than one version of the past in his poetry, even different fathers. At theoutset (mid  sixties) the figure based on his actual father sums up apositive in  heritance of skills and values which the poet transmutes within his own medium. Several poems dwell on the responsibility of \u2018following\u2019, and being followed by, earlier generations. In \u2018Follower\u2019 qualities of the father define qualities of the poetry: technical \u2018expertise\u2019, weight: \u2018His shoulders globed like a full sail.\u2019 The sense of ancestral solidity, rich rural continuity, in Death of a Naturalist (1966) is disturbed by those literal \u2018skeletons\u2019 from the past who appear in two Famine poems. Later, Wintering Out (1972) leads Heaney \u2018into [the] trail\u2019 of more insubstantial forebears than his farming fathers. Flitting wraiths symbolise discontinuities rather than continuity: the deprivations and repressions both of Irish history in the long term, and Ulster history in the short term. Heaney\u2019s gloss on \u2018The Tollund Man\u2019 initiates him into this tragic family: \u2018[he] seemed to me like an ancestor almost, one of my old uncles, one of those moustached archaic faces you used to meet all over the Irish country  side.\u201934 (\u2018Moustached archaic faces\u2019 is, curiously, a quotation from Philip Larkin\u2019s poem \u2018MCMXIV\u2019.) In contrast with the Tollund Man\u2019s attenuated condition, the early poem \u2018Ancestral Photograph\u2019 begins: \u2018Jaws puff round and solid as a turnip.\u2019 Heaney\u2019s most cel  ebrated poem about his father, \u2018The Harvest Bow\u2019 in Field Work (1979), reverts to the more tanglible-of-his family-histowes. A re  newed vision of poetry as calling on the father\u2019s \u2018gift\u2019 and \u2018mellowed silence\u2019, rather than breaking silences of dispossession, poetry as peace-maker despite the changed \u2018spirit\u2019 of the times, attaches to a drawn snare Slipped lately by the spirit of the corn Yet burnished by its passage, and still warm. o -e ^states 6 '01 I*; ijre C\\S.

W hat might be termed \u2018the aspirational approach\u2019 tends to receive least modification - Nationalist history still proving its literary seductive  ness. Exemplified by Paulin\u2019s Liberty Tree this approach derives from the corporate Field Day position, including more complex manifestations in Friel\u2019s drama. Seamus Deane\u2019s introduction to Friel\u2019s Selected Plays stresses how sundered Donegal haunts his imagination as \u2018a powerful image of possibility\u2019.35This image crys  tallises Friel\u2019s protest against what Deane calls \u2018the sense of a whole history of failure concentrated into a crisis over a doomed community or group\u2019.36Pointing to the sources of Friel\u2019s themes in a community robbed by history, robbed of history, Deane repeats such words and phrases as \u2018depressed and depressing atmosphere\u2019, \u2018apathy\u2019, \u2018desolation\u2019, \u2018failure\u2019, \u2018crisis\u2019, \u2018socially depressed and politically dislocated\u2019. This language partly derives from psychology: the termin  ology for depressive psychosis. Friel in Translations applies a kind of therapy to this psychosis by offering Northern Catholics an alternative history, cultural self-respect, however \u2018doomed\u2019 that Gaelic culture itself is shown to be. Translations can be read as an \u2018image of possibility\u2019 to redeem the more recent past in the North: an aisling. It fits Oliver MacDonagh\u2019s phrase for the goal of Gaelic revivalists in the twenties: a \u2018land...repeopled, in imagination, by a pre-colonial society, free of the stains and shames of anglicisation\u2019.37The aisling is the cultural figure that exemplifies the paralysing contradiction between epochalism and essentialism in Irish Nationalism. Liberty Tree, too, sets out to \u2018father history\u2019, to sire the future on \u2018images of the past\u2019. Paulin\u2019s \u2018image of possibility\u2019 for Ireland, for the Protestant people of the North, is a date - 1798. Another date, 1912, represents the contrasting nadir, and completes his vision of Ulster history as decline and fall from an ideal. \u2018Desertmartin\u2019 \u2018[sees] a plain/Presbyterian grace sour, then harden,/As a free strenuous spirit changes/To a servile defiance\u2019. Decline and fall, like failure and possibility, rules out merely developmental and evolutionary understandings of history. Even Paulin\u2019s \u2018critical position .. .is founded on an idea of identity which has as yet no formal or institutional existence. It assumes the existence of a non-sectarian, republican state which comprises the whole island of Ireland.\u201938The aisling as literary theory? Similarly, Paulin\u2019s Field Day pamphlet, A New Look at the Language Qiiestion, proposes a more \u2018institutional existence\u2019 for \n￼-e- Paulin aspires to redeem history, to start again from 1798 with \u2018a pure narrative before him\u2019 (\u2018L\u2019Envie de Commencement\u2019). Derek Mahon\u2019s greater pessimism about the sin of being born into history begets a recurrent imaginative hankering to abolish \u2018daylong/twilights of misery\u2019, to cut short its universally disastrous course. If Paulin often approaches history with Calvinist denunciation, Mahon more radically transposes the evangelist alter ego he satirises in \u2018Ecclesiastes\u2019. \u2018Another Sunday Morning\u2019 in The Hunt by Night (1982) calls poetry \u2018A sort of winged sandwich board/El-Grecoed to receive the Lord\u2019. o This disposition to say \u2018The End is Nigh\u2019 makes him in one sense a son of his fathers. Mahon\u2019s fundamentalist view of Ulster Prot  estants as \u2018a lost tribe\u2019, rather than the elect, extends to the whole human race, and its lack of truly human or spiritual qualities. His poetry\u2019s grand prophetic sweep embraces \u2018civilisations\u2019, the beginning and the end, \u2018the biblical span\u2019; contracts history into a Beckettian \u2018instant\u2019. \u2018Another Sunday Morning\u2019 casts the poet as \u2018A chiliastic prig\u2019, i.e. a millenarian. John Wilson Foster, discussing millenarian aspects of W.R. Rodgers\u2019s vision, cites millenarianism as a tradition which looks for \u2018sudden divine intervention to destroy the existing order\u2019.'10 M ahon\u2019s less \u2018enthusiastic\u2019 version dispenses with divine agency and ecstatic revelation, but projects spiritual renewal through destruction (compare Women in Love). However, man may not be among the worthy permitted to survive. In \u2018The Antigone Riddle\u201941 Shy minerals contract at the sound of his voice, Cod point in silence when his bombers pass, And the windfall waits In silence for his departure Before it drops in Silence to the long grass. \u2018Matthew V. 29-30\u201942preaches an absurdist but logical sermon on the text \u2018Lord, mine eye offended, so I plucked it out\u2019. Here the o Longley 150-172 4/5/94 11:34 am Page 160 \u2018WHEN DID YOU LAST SEE YOUR FATHER?\u2019 the English language in Ireland, a dictionary to codify what he regards as linguistic and literary \u2018anarchy\u2019.wThis aspiration towards an ideal language sometimes distracts the actual language of Paulin\u2019s poetry'. Words, on the whole, take an evolutionary view of themselves, \u2018Worn new\u2019 in Edward Thomas\u2019s paradox. Paulin\u2019s impatience to establish a new vocabulary, tartly hascd-on \u2018a relished [Ulster] dialect\u2019, gives words like the following little time to settle: \u2018glooby\u2019, \u2018scuffy\u2019, \u2018claggy\u2019, \u2018choggy\u2019. As well as adjectives which aspire to exist, Paulin also repeats adjectives of aspiration \u2018green\u2019, \u2018sweet\u2019, \u2018equal\u2019. And his poetry\u2019s general dependence on adjectives seems to me over- insistent, willed, willing - an effort to institutionalise the future. \"ko ~bCconstitute \n￼Longley 150-172 4/5/94 11:34 am Page \u2018WHEN DID YOU LAST SEE YOUR FATHER?\u2019 161 poet intervenes to destroy the \u2018offending\u2019 world himself, including \u2018evaporation of all seas,/the extinction of heavenly bodies\u2019. Although the first line of \u2018A Disused Shed in Co. Wexford\u2019 gives history a last chance - Even now there are places where a thought might grow \u2014 Mahon\u2019s historical consciousness, as guilty and punitive as Beckett\u2019s, not only turns biblical Protestantism inside out, but contradicts Whig history and deplores Belfast\u2019s industrial history. His poetry denies progress, views the rise of the bourgeoisie as a descent into \u2018barbarism\u2019, and cries woe to a houseproud \u2018civilisation\u2019: on stormy nights our strong double glazing groans with foreknowledge of death, the fridge with a great wound... (\u2018Gipsies\u2019)45 Michael Longley\u2019s perception of history, lacking Paulin\u2019s and Mahon\u2019s religious and prophetic colouring, concentrates on the empirical issue of whether different histories can be accommodated, either imaginatively or communally, in a context symbolised by the last line of \u2018Letter to Seamus Heaney\u20194as \u2018A wind-encircled burial mound\u2019- anothercemetery\u2019.\u2018OnSlieveGullion\u201945specificallymusters such histories: On Slieve Gullion \u2018men and mountain meet\u2019, O \u2019Hanlon\u2019s territory, the rapparee, Home of gods, backdrop for a cattle raid, The Lake of Cailleach Beara at the top That slaked the severed head of Conor M or... One figure in the landscape is \u2018A paratrooper on reconnaissance\u2019 who \u2018sweats up the slopes of Slieve Gullion/With forty pounds of history on his back\u2019 - a sign of intertextual dialogue with Seamus Heaney\u2019s \u2018The Toome Road\u2019,* in which a speaker who encounters camouflaged armoured cars opposes to their intrusive presence \u2018The invisible, untoppled omphalos\u2019. In \u2018On Slieve Gullion\u2019 Longley registers his own English connections in the phrase \u2018Both strangers here\u2019, and leaves the poem\u2019s mythic and historical ingredients in a state of suspension on the mountain. This implies the contemporary scarcity of such balm as \u2018slaked the severed head of Conor Mor\u2019. As in \u2018Wounds\u2019, Longley\u2019s version of decline and fall differs from Paulin\u2019s. But if \u2018On Slieve Gullion\u2019 finds no answers to the weight of the past, to \u2018forty pounds of history\u2019, it does not embrace the deter- \n￼Longley 150-172 4/5/94 11:35 am Page 162 \u2018WHEN DID YOU LAST SEE YOUR FATHER?\u2019 minism which characterises John Montague\u2019s vision and which derives from the \u2018integrity of [the] quarrel\u2019 between the Ulster com  munities, \u2018two crazed peoples\u201947- an emphasis that contrasts with Friel\u2019s concentration on the Catholic communal psyche. Montague favours the word \u2018again\u2019: \u2018Again that note!\u2019, \u2018Once again, it happens\u2019; \u2018Again, the unwinding road\u2019.48 A hazard of perceiving events as cyclical, is that style, too, can develop habits of repetition. \u2018Pattern\u2019 and \u2018ritual\u2019, also favourite words, sometimes apply to Montague\u2019s own technique, stiffening poems into a species of heraldry which excludes or precludes the active verb, rhythmical dynamic. The main process attributed to history concerns what is \u2018lost\u2019 or \u2018gone\u2019 (another favourite word), with loss itself a pattern - familial in the poem called \u2018Process\u2019:50\u2018time\u2019s gullet devouring/parents whose children/ are swallowed in turn\u2019. After 1969 history repeats itself in Montague\u2019s imagination, presents itself as pre-processed, or perhaps as an impasse between the perspectives of \u2018mortality\u2019 and \u2018continuum\u2019. However, Ulster novelists also find it difficult to evade determin  istic structures. Martin\u2019s The Ceremony ofInnocence and The Road to Ballyshannon, Mac Laverty\u2019s Lamb and Cal, all centre on characters whose options narrow to a single historical necessity. The conclusion of Stamping Ground falls into a similar mould/ despite Leitch\u2019s gesture towards the positive -f a girl raped by three young men implausibly feels \u2018sorry for them now more than anything\u2019.51Hetty essentially shares in the socio-sexual fatality, emanating from \u2018closed places of the spirit\u2019,52which has already engulfed the Valley\u2019s older generation. H er post-coital joie de vivre does not outweigh the past, any more than does a wistful and wishful vision near the end of The Road to Ballyshannon-. \u2018I see it,\u2019 the sergeant said. \u2018I see it.\u2019 Through the mist and the broken cloud a dolphin swam among the stars. \u2018I see it. It\u2019s a dolphin, isn\u2019t it? And it\u2019s free.\u2019 It was then the sergeant realised that the boy\u2019s right hand was held up by a tree root and the eyes that glistened to the night sky were dead.\u201d Relentlessly deterministic, Martin\u2019s fictional techniques shoot home, with loud clangs, the bolts which circumscribe existence. His epi  graphs pre-condition the reader as well: from Marx in The Ceremony o f Innocence: Men make their own history, but they do not make it just as they please; they do not make it under circumstances chosen by themselves, but under circumstances directly encountered, given and transmitted from the past. The tradition of all the dead generations weighs like a night  mare on the brain of the living. \n￼Longley 150-172 4/5/94 11:35 am Page \u2018WHEN DID YOU LAST SEE YOUR FATHER?\u2019 163 And from Nietzsche in The Road to Ballyshannon: \u2018[Man] wonders ...about himself - that he cannot learn to forget, but hangs on the past: however far or fast he runs, that chain runs with him.\u2019 The Ceremony o f Innocence incorporates quite a rich historical and social panorama of Belfast since the Second World War; but all this gives birth to a boy\u2019s destiny as \u2018a small black cross among the thousand and more crosses that line the lawns of the City Hall when the peace- marchers keep their silent, lonely vigil...\u201954A leaner, less rhetorical work, set in 1922, The Road to Ballyshannon follows two Republican fugitives and their RIC sergeant hostage to an inevitable rendezvous. Although only the latter escapes with his life, his son has earlier been killed by the Republicans. The sergeant is additionally doomed to remain \u2018a hostage of the dead\u2019,55 because during the enforced journey he has become a surrogate father to the younger of his captors - perhaps another touch of wistful transcendence. Mac Laverty\u2019s Lamb also turns on surrogate fatherhood, but within one community. To make altruistic amends for the authoritarianism of a boys\u2019 borstal run by the Christian Brothers, Brother Sebastian (Michael Lamb) takes rebellious Owen on an escape-journey. Its time, money, and spirit \u2018inevitably\u2019 run out: He had started with a pure loving simple ideal but it had gone foul on him, turned inevitably into something evil. It had been like this all his life, with the Brothers, with the very country he came from. The beautiful fly with the hook embedded...Owen was dead. He had killed him to save him, although he loved him more than anyone else in his life.5* The sentimental tinge here, a counterpart to the melodrama informing Martin\u2019s doomed odysseys, also weakens the impact of Cal\u2019s fate. And if sex is dodged in Lamb, it seems unlikely in Cat. Cal\u2019s guilt- ridden love affair with the widow of an RUC reservist, to whose murder by the IRA he has been accessory, ends thus: \u2018he stood in a dead man\u2019s Y-fronts listening to the charge, grateful that at last someone was going to beat him to within an inch of his life\u2019.57What in the case of poetry causes predictable cadences, in the case of fiction causes predictable plots, predictable emotional conformations: ideal glimpses belying a masochism under history\u2019s iron crushers which the novelist\u2019s sensibility shares with a passive victim-hero. But the (would-be realist) novelist must work with society as it is. Poetry has perhaps less excuse if it fails to maintain the tension between creative dynamic and historical stasis, to detect hairfine tremors or locate chinks in determinism\u2019s defences. Perhaps Paulin\u2019s idealism weighs too hard on the dynamic scale-pan, Montague\u2019s determinism too hard on the static. Both also, unlike Mahon, write JbdL- \n￼164 \u2018WHEN DID YOU LAST SEE YOUR FATHER?\u2019 very explicitly about Irish history, which given half a chance will write the poems itself, turn idealism or aspiration back into deter  minism again, book the text in advance like Coulter\u2019s graves. Seamus Heaney\u2019s \u2018Bogland\u201958 famously does its own digging, conceives the past as a dimension to be explored dynamically rather than received statically: \u2018Our pioneers keep striking/inwards and downwards\u2019, and so do the poem\u2019s rhythms. This conflates historical enquiry with psychic investigation, and Heaney\u2019s subsequent sound  ings resemble Jungian therapy, rather than Friel\u2019s implied prescrip  tion of electro-convulsion. Heaney\u2019s methods affirm the presence of depths and layers whereby the past imprints individual and community, a \u2018script indelibly written into the nervous system\u2019.59 Hence \u2018Broagh,/its low tattoo/among the windy boortrees.\u201960Yet this begins to edge towards the mythic inevitabilities that take hold in North (1975) and give his forms, too, a more deterministic cast. Perhaps the concept of the \u2018Bog People\u2019, subsuming history in a single \u2018icon\u2019, \u2018an archetypal pattern\u2019, was bound to have such an effect.61Again, the two fathers of Heaney\u2019s poetry merge into general  ised ancestor-worship: \u2018pinioned by ghosts/and affections\u2019 (\u2018Viking Dublin\u2019); \u2018god of the waggon,/the hearth-feeder\u2019 (\u2018Kinship\u2019). The iconography and rituals of North (which I have discussed elsewhere)62also freeze the fluid religious element which has always permeated Heaney\u2019s imaginative relation to the past. This - very different from Mahon\u2019s and Paulin\u2019s theologising - began with the animistic natural magic of Heaney\u2019s childhood landscape (captured in Death ofa Naturalist) when the \u2018pump marked an original descent into earth...centred and staked the imagination, made its foundation the foundation of the omphalos itself\u2019.63In his lecture \u2018The Sense of the Past\u2019 (my italics), Heaney traces a progression from the child\u2019s \u2018intimate, almost animal response\u2019 to \u2018the mystery and claims of time past...the sense of belonging to a family and a place\u2019, to \u2018those images which widen this domestic past into a community or a national past\u2019 and offer \u2018a dream of the past\u2019.64 In the latter connection he describes the enduring mystique within his imagination of a mass- rock picture with its \u2018emotional drama\u2019.65Yet, these two ways of apprehending the past, as the second accrues political meanings, cease to be progressive or concentric. Do the ripples widen evenly from the pump in the yard to the historical nation? Are the two fathers really one? How far does the \u2018common emotional ground of memory and belonging\u2019 extend? Is history-identical to - whose? - collective unconscious? (In \u2018Bogland\u2019 this analogy is a matter of subtler metaphorical suggestion.) Similar problems arise from \n￼Longley 150-172 4/5/94 11:36 am Page \u2018WHEN DID YOU LAST SEE YOUR FATHER?\u2019 165 Heaney\u2019s landscaped female-frgw© representing \u2018mother ground\u2019, origins: the eternal mythic presence of the past, as opposed to the father who at least participates in generational cycles. Heaney\u2019s omphalos or Mother Ireland in his own backyard at  tempts a winning throw in the poetic, as well as political, game of naturalising religio-historical origins. Others, like Montague, have gambled on the dolmen as symbolic touchstone. Louis MacNeice reached back to the early Christian era when his aspiration to belong reached a qualified climax in \u2018The Once-in-Passing\u2019:6 As though the window opened And the ancient cross on the hillside meant myself. But beyond all monuments, the land remains \u2018the stable element\u2019 in poetry too, whether inscribed with historical essences or with revisionist desires. In \u2018Rocks\u2019 (after Guillevic)67 Mahon uses geology, the durability of rocks (\u2018Their dream of holding fast/In the elemental flux\u2019), to dwarf the human episode \u2018Lying in their shadows/in the last traces of time\u2019. More broadly, the (non-human) animal, vegetable and mineral harbour \u2018The Banished Gods\u2019,68who sit out the centuries In stone, water And the hearts of trees, Lost in a reverie of their own natures... Longley partly integrates natural and human history; partly sees Nature as improving on man\u2019s record of environmental accommo  dation, \u2018rinsing\u2019 the burial-mound as does poetry itself: The spring tide circles and excavates A shrunken ramshackle pyramid Rinsing cleaner scapulae, tibias, Loose teeth, cowrie and nautilus shells Before seeping after sun and moon T o pour cupfuls into the larks\u2019 nests, To break a mirror on the grazing And lift minnows over the low bridge.6\u2019 (\u2018Spring Tide\u2019) The Southern Irish poet Paul Durcan, in \u2018Before the Celtic Yoke\u201971,' gets rid of the past by conceiving a platonic landscape, innocent of history\u2019s invasion. Pre-human, not post-human like Mahon\u2019s millenarian dream, at once Genesis and Revelation, re-visionary rather than revisionist, this variant on the aisling once again suggests that Irish poetic imaginations are caught between trying to transfix history, to finish it, and to begin it. Durcan imagines the aisling\u2019s object defying history-ridden poets and speaking for \u2018herselP: & n ncXs Del phic. e- \n￼Longley 150-172 4/5/94 11:36 am Page 166 \u2018WHEN DID YOU LAST SEE YOUR FATHER?\u2019 My vocabularies are boulders cast up on time\u2019s beaches; Masses of sea-rolled stones reared up in mile-high ricks Along the shores and curving coasts of all my island... IV Paul Muldoon\u2019s poetry does not assail the tyranny of the past by any such bold strokes as \u2018Before the Celtic Yoke\u2019. Instead, it suffers death by a thousand cuts. Most fundamentally, Muldoon enquires into the whole business of the writer, or anyone, looking to history at all. To begin with a digression: Muldoon\u2019s points of departure are thrown into relief by the contrary methods of Heaney\u2019s long poem \u2018Station Island\u2019, and Brian Moore\u2019s fiction. The scenario of \u2018Station Island\u2019 not only builds in religio-historical pietas, but an appeal to (or for) higher authority. Heaney\u2019s theme of following or \u2018trailing\u2019 returns on a larger scale as his pilgrim seeks spiritual and artistic guidance by conversing with ghosts: various male voices from and of the past, surrogate fathers or \u2018fosterers\u2019 - all from the Catholic tradition - in the guise of priests, schoolmasters, mentors, master- writers. A \u2018hard\u2019 macho Joyce is hailed as \u2018Old father, mother\u2019s son\u2019.71 Although that last voice urges \u2018swim/out on your own\u2019 the poem itself enacts an entrapment, not least in its thraldom to literary history. \u2018Exemplary\u2019 is a favourite critical term of Heaney\u2019s, and Seamus Deane salutes what seems more like dependency than freedom, when he says: \u2018Heaney has begun to consider his literary heritage more carefully, to interrogate it in relation to his Northern and violent experience, to elicit from it a style of survival as a poet.\u201972Thus \u2018Station Island\u2019 may stage an incomplete liberation- struggle. Indeed, its Joycean denoument recycles, rather than revises, the patriarchal/artistic will to power: the schema is that of initiation into manhood, acceptance by elders of the tribe. Moore\u2019s Fergus (1971), perhaps also seeking a style of literary survival, revisits the past within a secular scenario very like that o f \u2018Station Island\u2019. Fergus Fadden, serious novelist hoping to strike gold as a Hollywood script  writer, is literally haunted in his Californian beach-house by ghosts from his Irish family past. He too holds \u2018conversations with the dead\u201973(and younger versions of the living). His dead father, a socially and religiously conservative authority-figure, who resembles Gavin\u2019s father in The Emperor of Ice-Cream, heads the haunters or hunters of a less securely liberated psyche than Gavin\u2019s becomes. Moore\u2019s resurrection of a \u2018father\u2019s world\u2019 bears very explicitly on o ar-b'ifi'ci# I 3\\a S ti \n￼Longley 150-172 4/5/94 11:37 am Page ^5,7 'WHEN DID YOU LAST SEE YOUR FATHER?\u2019 167 the theme John Wilson Foster sees as first surfacing in An Answer from Limbo (1962): \u2018primitivism and provincialism become virtues, bulwarks against the erosive hypocrisies of modern cosmopolitan life\u2019.74Fergus articulates a crisis close to the novelist\u2019s own sensibility: He stood...hardly able to believe that a few moments ago, far from fleeing his ghosts, he had pursued them with questions...Until now, he had thought that, like everyone else, he exorcised his past by living it. But he was not like everyone else. His past had risen up this morning, vivid and uncontrollable, shouldering into his present.\u201d However, Moore\u2019s externalisation of interior or unconscious dialogue involves fairly stock characters and responses. The father\u2019s anticlimactic last words are: \u2018If you have not found a meaning, then your life is meaningless.\u201976 Moore\u2019s fiction after Fergus oscillates within the terms of this over-neat antithesis. His protagonists find or lose some kind of faith, with the supernatural underlining the issue in Catholics (1972), The Great Victorian Collection (1975), Cold Heaven (1983) and Black Rohe (1985). The Mangan Inheritance (1979) pursues, antithetically to Fergus, the question of faith in the past itself. Keeping the faith, whether religiously or historically, draws on the same font of Irish feeling. James Mangan, a Canadian not an expatriate Irishman, becomes obsessed with proving his kinship e to the nineteenth-century poet James Clarence Mangan. His quest for genealogical ratification of his character and talents ends in tears, in \u2018hated self-images\u2019,77 in the shattering of a talismanic ancestral daguerrotype, in a return home to healthier emotion about his father\u2019s death. Moore\u2019s dialectic between Irish total recall and Californian amnesia derives - like excessive determinism or idealism - from Ulster experience, but may be too much of a swinging pendulum to extend it artistically. Foster calls Fergus \u2018more of a re-hash than an advance\u2019.78Despite his variations on a theme, Moore\u2019s historical imagination seems arrested between a futureless Ireland (doubly so since it belongs to his past) and a pastless North America. Thirty years younger than Moore, Muldoon so far shows no signs of augmenting Foster\u2019s \u2018wry irony in the sight of yesterday\u2019s apostates becoming today\u2019s nostalgics\u2019.79 His poetry questions its own authority along with origins, foundations, heritage, precedent, preceptor and pedigree. For instance, in Quoof (1983) the trans  atlantic dimension of \u2018The More a Man Has the More a Man Wants\u201980 is partly a way of suggesting the remoteness, the archaic distance, of Irish-American bloodlines: On the Staten Island Ferry two men are dickering \n￼Longley 150-172 4/5/94 11:38 am Page e- 168 \u2018WHEN DID YOU LAST SEE YOUR FATHER?\u2019 over the price of a shipment of Armalites, as Henry Thoreau was wont to quibble with Ralph Waldo Emerson. The scene then moves to the Algonquin where, in a parody of Young Ireland\u2019s heroic genealogies, the protagonist encounters \u2018a flurry/of sprites,/the assorted shades/of Wolfe Tone, Napper Tandy ...Then, Thomas Meagher/darts up from the Missouri/on a ray/of the morning star/to fiercely ask/what has become of Irish hurling?\u2019 (This poem is no respecter of ghosts.) \u2018The Frog\u201981 attacks from a different angle the notion that \u2018images of the past\u2019 hold lessons, can be made \u2018exemplary\u2019. The speaker to whom the frog-image occurs seems poised between alternative politics of the poem: \u2018I set aside hammer and chisel/and take him on the trowel\u2019. \u2018Hammer and chisel\u2019 implies the egotistical (and patriarchal) sublime: coercion of the image to fit an agenda. \u2018Take him on the trowel\u2019, like the poem\u2019s self-image as \u2018another small upheaval/amongst the rubble\u2019 (\u2018Troubles\u2019), implies negative capability. \u2018The Frog\u2019 tries out the first approach, but stops short: The entire population of Ireland m springs from a pair left to stand 0- overnight in a pond in the gardens of Trinity College, two bottles of wine left there to chill after the Act of Union. There is, surely, in this story a moral. A moral for our times... This anti-Aesop, anti-Davisite fable plays down 1800 as much as Paulin plays up 1798. It also criticises Heaney\u2019s \u2018Act of Union\u2019 as not only portentously futile, but radical chic, a frivolously aesthetic dabbling in violent waters: \u2018What if I put him to my head/and squeezed it out of him,/like the juice of freshly squeezed limes,/or a lemon sorbet?\u2019 A related Muldoonian moral queries the status of historical stories themselves. \u2018History\u201982embarks on research: \u2018Where and when exactly did we first have sex?\u2019 and obliquely concludes that only imaginative truth can be trusted since a possible location is \u2018the room where MacNeice wrote \u201cSnow\u201d,/Or the room where they say he wrote \u201cSnow\u201d.\u2019 MacNeice\u2019s poem emerges as the only sure thing in a world of shaky facts. (\u2018Exactly\u2019 belongs to aesthetics in \u2018The Frog\u2019 too.) Similarly, the poet in \u2018Lunch with Pancho Villa\u201983 undermines a whole industry of publication on Northern Ireland when he states: \u2018there\u2019s no such book, so far as I know,/As Horv it Happened Here,/Though there may be. There may.\u2019 -e- \n￼\u2018WHEN DID YOU LAST SEE YOUR FATHER?\u2019 169 Muldoon\u2019s poetry, then, attempts to loosen the grip of the past on both life and literature, perhaps as epitomised by a habituated pump attendant: \u2018grown so used/to hold-ups he calls after them,/Beannacht De ar pn ohair \\ 84 He \u2018interrogates history\u2019 in a more genuine sense than do many who make such a claim. His techniques sabotage all kinds of certainty about how \u2018far\u2019 we \u2018know\u2019 into the past or future. Hence the subjunctives, conditionals, syntactical ambiguities, refusals of historic tenses. The locus of the poetry is an un-(easy present- continuous, at once an ironic echo of Ulster\u2019s \u2018eternal interim\u2019 (\u2018Lull\u2019), and \u2018exactly\u2019 where language tries to break into the future: How often have I carried our family word for the hot water bottle to a strange bed...\u20195 (\u2018Quoof\u2019) To defamiliarise is also to defamilialise. Throughout Muldoon\u2019s poetry the father is a persistent metaphysical shadow. Behind, rather than both behind and in front like Heaney\u2019s father-figure, he rep  resents \u2018what is...immediately over my shoulder\u2019. Some of Muldoon\u2019s early poems dramatise the son\u2019s psycho-sexual maturation - presented in Freudian, rather than Jungian, terms. \u2018The Waking Father\u201986 (from Neiv Weather, 1973) includes a disturbing infantile Oedipal fantasy: When my father stood out in the shallows It occurred to me The spricklies might have been pirhanas, The river a red carpet rolling out from where he had just stood... In \u2018Duffy\u2019s Circus\u2019 87 (from Mules, 1977) the speaker-son\u2019s drive towards individuation reaches adolescence. He ignores his father\u2019s Polonius-like \u2018nuts of wisdom\u2019, \u2018loses\u2019 him, and ends up absorbing rawer facts of life, sex and violence: \u2018From under a freighter/I watched a man sawing a woman in half. This Freudian drama shades into the father\u2019s function as history-bearer. Sometimes (as part of Muldoon\u2019s running demurral with Heaney) he becomes an amalgam of archetypes/stereotypes. \u2018The Mixed Marriage\u201988, with its \u2018school-mistress\u2019 mother and rurally atavistic father, parodies Lawrentian oppositions between super-ego and id. The father further dimmed the light T o get back to hunting with ferrets O r the factions of the faction-fights - The Ribbon Boys, the Caravats. \n￼Longley 150-172 4/5/94 11:38 am Page 170 \u2018WHEN DID YOU LAST SEE YOUR FATHER?\u2019 Two poems in Why Brownlee Left, \u2018October 1950\u2019 and \u2018ImmramaTM, more directly challenge blood-conscious imperatives. The former presents conception not as determined or (wholly) determining but as \u2018chance\u2019 which might lead to \u2018Anything wild or wonderful\u2019. The speaker of the latter at first seems eager to join the poetic paternity suite: \u2018I, too, have trailed my father\u2019s spirit\u2019, but orthodox Irish biography or literary cliche (\u2018mud-walled cabin\u2019, \u2018farm where he was first hired out\u2019, \u2018building-site\u2019) has an unorthodox South American finale: \u2018That\u2019s him on the verandah, drinking rum/W ith a man who might be a N azi...\u2019 This impugns not only any mytholo  gised purity of family stock, but doctrines of such purity. Earlier the father\u2019s authority and factuality were revoked by the very ded  ication of Muldoon\u2019s New Weather: \u2018For my Fathers and Mothers.\u2019 His debutant historical pluralism prepared for other pluralities and mixtures in the poetry, subtler versions of those surrogacies or difficult mixed parentages in fiction: mongrels, mutations, doubles, androgyny and sexual ambivalence (\u2018The Bearded Woman, by Ribera\u201990 with her \u2018Willowy, and clean-shaven\u2019 consort), alter egos, alternative lives, promiscuity of cultural reference. Muldoon\u2019s puns and rhymes endow words themselves with multiple identities, strange bedfellows, surprisingly extended families, and his poems unfold through associations that unsettle the reader. The title-poem of Mules presents a son witnessing a father wit  nessing an awkward birth: We had loosed them into one field. I watched Sam Parsons and my quick father Tense for the punch below their belts, For what was neither one thing or the other.91 Among other things, this problematic hybrid symbolises offspring of the so-called \u2018two traditions\u2019 in Ulster, including Muldoon\u2019s poetry itself. But fathers\u2019 breeding too, as Tmmrama\u2019 suggests, can be suspect. The longer poem Tmmram\u201992 takes shape as a search for the father, for an explanation of some dirty business in the pastwhich forces the son to re-think autonomy and free association: 1was fairly and squarely behind the eight That morning in Foster\u2019s pool-hall When it came to me out of the blue In the shape of a sixteen-ounce billiard cue That lent what he said some little weight. \u2018Your old man was an ass-hole. That makes an ass-hole out of you.\u2019 My grandfather hailed from New York State. My grandmother was part Cree. This must be some new strain in my pedigree... \n￼\u2018WHEN DID YOU LAST SEE YOUR FATHER?\u2019 171 I suppose that I should have called the cops Or called it a day and gone home And done myself, and you, a favour. But I wanted to know more about my father. But, shifty and shifting, the father eludes pursuit: \u2018He would flee, to La Paz, then to Buenos Aires,/From alias to alias.\u2019 The son does not set out to avenge an entirely innocent father, as he does in Immram Mael Duin, the medieval voyage tale on which Muldoon\u2019s \u2018Immram\u2019 is loosely, if not licentiously, based. However, at the end of the poem he is released like Mael Duin from thraldom to the past, and \u2018happily\u2019 returns to \u2018Foster\u2019s pool-room\u2019 (a genetic pun on the fostering of Mael Duin). As he moves to rejoin the \u2018flow\u2019 of the living, the poem seems to resolve the father-son conflict on both its Freudian and its historical levels. In \u2018Gathering Mushrooms\u2019\u201d we glimpse the father once again as a familiarly solid rural figure: \u2018He\u2019ll glance back from under his peaked cap/without breaking rhythm\u2019. Muldoon may partly allude to Heaney\u2019s father-figure, and, as elsewhere, to Heaney as a literary father-figure (\u2018rhythm\u2019 in Heaney\u2019s poems fuses poetry and rural work). Such fathers are now perceived as sadly obsolescent: \u2018one of those ancient warriors/before the rising tide\u2019 - a helpless Canute or Cuchulain. Set \u2018fifteen years on\u2019, and thus straddling recent history, \u2018Gathering Mushrooms\u2019 presents the \u2018tide\u2019 of violence as psychedelic transformation. The substitution of magic mushrooms for the ordinary variety symbolises a grotesque mutation or regression of tradition. A reversed aisling, the poem is also a slow-motion reprise of \u2018Easter 1916\u2019 (\u2018changed utterly\u2019) in which nothing - or a changeling - gets born. The speaker, his head \u2018grown into the head of a horse\u2019, finds in his mouth the words of a Republican dirty-protester instructing: \u2018I f sing you must, let your song/tell of treading your own dung.'' The speaker implicitly resists imperatives delivered by the past (\u2018dung\u2019) in the name of the future (\"the day we leap/into our true domain'), history\u2019s Davisite attempt to dictate to the poet. If Mahon demolishes Whig history, you might say that Muldoon deconstructs its opposite. He exorcises the hovering \u2018ghost-life\u2019 of mythic history, what Oliver MacDonagh rather euphemistically terms \u2018an absence of a developmental or sequential view of past events\u2019.94But his poetry does not simply or simplistically walk away from atavism into agnostic daylight. Nor does it weigh too heavily on either side of any antithesis, but resembles Brownlee\u2019s abandoned horses Shifting their weight from foot to Foot, and gazing into the future* \n￼Longley 150-172 4/5/94 11:39 am Page 172 \u2018WHEN DID YOU LAST SEE YOUR FATHER?\u2019 Muldoon negotiates that small space, that inch, between necessity and possibility, with an integrity faithful above all to the present. \u2018Cherish the Ladies\u2019,96 like other Muldoon poems, takes place in the present tense and is aware of itself as a tiny piece of historical process if not progress: In this, my last poem about my father, there may be time enough for him to fill their drinking-trough and run his eye over his three mooley heifers. Such a well-worn path, I know, from here to the galvanized bath. The phrase \u2018my last poem\u2019 could mean either final or most recent, thus suggesting work-in-progress. \u2018Cherish the Ladies\u2019 (like \u2018Immram\u2019) braves the reader\u2019s imagined boredom with father-poems: \u2018Such a well-worn path/I know.\u2019 And it restores for the space of the poem the rural archetype of the father by insisting on the actuality of his opening \u2018the stand-pipe\u2019 - an image for begetting. Like \u2018Gathering Mushrooms\u2019, \u2018Cherish the Ladies\u2019 incorporates an italicised alterna  tive poem, alternative history, alternative future controlled by the past: I know, too, you would rather I saw behind the hedge to where the pride o f the herd, though not an Irish bull, would cherish the ladies with his electric cattle-prod. As it is, in my last poem about my father he opens the stand-pipe and the water scurries along the hose till it\u2019s curled in the bath - One heifer may look up and make a mental note, then put her nose back to the salt-lick of the world. What might be going on, or written up, behind the hedge smacks of an abusive heritage (there are parodic references to folk-song). As ever, Muldoon discriminates between dead and living tradition, between apparent and real breaks with the past, between the oppress  ively, tribally progenitive \u2018pride of the herd\u2019 and the more admirable father who really \u2018cherishes\u2019 the future - even a female future - who makes available \u2018the salt-lick of the world\u2019.
