She stretched her throat and uttered a 'Cock-a-doodle-doo', followed by the blackbird's tune and the kite's piercing mew. Two notes in combination then issued from her bill: the wren's miniature piping and the oriole's trill. Stunned by this exhibition, my torment let me be: its gnawing grip relented, and left my tooth pain-free. Off to her nest the thrush went, and I took up my pen. >*ay God send her back to me if toothache strikes /Jcr/o-K1 £ \n￼Vestiunt silve tenera ramorum Mr*\u2014 virgulta, suis onerata pomis, ^ \u2014 canunt de celsis sedibus palumbes \u2014 carmina cunctis.

A- Here is the crooning dove, the thrush's warbling; here is the blackbirds' well-remembered chorus; even the dunnock chirps its lowly twitter m under the elmtrees. 4s Here in the leaves the nightingale is joyful, pouring her long sweet whistle on the breezes; meanwhile the kite's voice, quavering and vibrant, m creaks through the heavens. Up soars the eagle, aiming for the stars; while lower the skylark floods the fields with music, rising and swooping, plummeting to earthward r a in her own fashion. #\u2022 Swiftly the swallow darts without alighting; quails are heard calling, jackdaws make their clamour so all the birds are celebrating summer, C P all of them singing. 4= None of the birds is like the little bee, though \u2014 model for maidens, chastity's example: no, only she who once cocooned the Christ-child r a safe in her belly. \n￼Iuvenilis lascivia et amoris suspiria tam sunt delectabilia ; qu* En Rosseinos en cante. 4 Kec est amoris nuncia, et hec inflammat basia et accendit incendia mei estus, que s'en vante® 4 Audivi sepe merulam dum movet ignis stipulam et hec pungit puellulam mil fiz desob quarante.
