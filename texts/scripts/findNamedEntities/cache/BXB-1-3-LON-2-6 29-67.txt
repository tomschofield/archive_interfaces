B. Yeats, \u2018Easter 1916\u2019 Say only this, \u2018They are dead. \u2019 Charles Sorley, \u2018Untitled\u2019 Commemorations are as selective as sympathies. They honour our dead, not your dead. Charles Haughey cannot visit Beal na Blath, let alone wear a poppy. And even when the same person or event is being commemorated, splits occur. Witness Christianity or Bodenstown. We might observe, too, that \u2018processions\u2019 to Bodens- town follow a Catholic model, despite the secularist beneath the sod, and that Protestant Ulster desired a Union Jack to hang for  ever over Carson\u2019s tomb in St Anne\u2019s Cathedral^Perhaps all public commemoration seeks authenticity by appeal to the religious instinct. In Ireland, however, the cross-overs between religious and political behaviour are peculiarly pervasive, subtle and unconscious. This essay borrows its title and some ideas from The Great War and Modern Memory, Paul Fussell\u2019s classic study of World War I in relation to English writing and English mentalities. Parts of Fussell\u2019s analysis also apply to Ireland. But the issue of the Somme and Ulster Protestant memory opens up further theological, as well as historical, contexts. Equally, Easter week, in consummating the alliance between nationalism and Catholicism, had special designs on Catholic memory. Thus, when the Rising and the Somme The Rising, the Somme and Irish Memory Edna Longley 29 \n￼Revising llie Rising , came lo be processed by state ideologies, the m anner of the: nemoration was shaped by sectarian idioms. 1 suggest tha ICatholics and Ulster Protestants not only tend to remembe xnt things, but to remember them in different ways. The\" monic structures differ: the categories, tropes, rituals,j ion, still the major psycho-cultural force in Ireland, has rfully influenced the forms of Irish memory, mmemoration is a means whereby communities renew their rligio: literally, what ties them together, the rope around the idual sticks. Seamus Heaney, whose poetry sometimes exemplifies and always understands religio in this sense, has evoked its operation at the Bloody Sunday funerals in Derry: The common funeral Unrolled its swaddling band, Lapping, tightening Till we were braced and bound Like brothers in a ring. (\u2018CasmllY\u2019 /'i'WfHTrr/f VV) I\u2022usuAltyJ Since all Northern Irish funerals remember other funerals, commemoration is a factor in funerals, as funeral in commemora  tions. Heaney\u2019s poem \u2018Casualty\u2019 itself commemorates a renegade who \u2018broke/O ur tribe's complicity\u2019 by disobeying an IRA order. Thus the word \u2018swaddling\u2019 may hint at a regressive or restrictive element in tribal cohesion. Similarly, \u2018bound\u2019 hovers between bond and bind, between solidarity and suffocation. Nonetheless (or all the more) Heaney\u2019s image captures Northern Irish tribal religio as it might also be found, though differently manifested, on a similar Protestant occasion. Perhaps Catholic Ireland was especially shocked by the Enniskillen bombing on Remembrance Day 1987 because a commemorative rite had been violated and the broken taboo, the nefas, was understood at a deep cultural level. Did even the murders at the church in Darkley cause as much revulsion? But copimemoration, communal religio, does not merely remember. It reinvents and reconstitutes according to present needs. For instance, 1641, the supposed Protestant race-memory of massacre at Catholic hands, took on a new lease of life during 30 \n￼The Rising, the Somme and Irish Memory ome Rule crisis. And the Wolfe Tone cult did not really get e ground until the centenary of his death in 1898 (a good y Irish \u2018traditions\u2019 were invented in the 1890s), or even later, p Dunne maintains that \u2018Tone\u2019s reputation was created long -jr.his death [principally] by Pearse\u2019s claim that Tone was the under of Irish Nationalism - a claim that became part of fficial nationalist orthodoxy after 1916, and has been a central JChe of official and popular political culture since 1922\u2019^CDtmtfe, fc)? Hence \u2018the Wolfe Tones\u2019 rather than, say, \u2018the Henry Joy [cCrackens\u2019. As for 1916 itself, the 1966 com m em oration :tually revived a waning piety. And 1966 fed into 1969. Although t'the Republic\u2019s anniversary celebrations turned off the incipiently \u2019post-nationalist generation of Fintan ()\u2019Tool^\u2019*they roused the \u2022\u2018atavisms of the North, Protestant as well as Catholic. Tricolours in west Belfast fanned the flames of Paisleyism. Here again Seamus Heaney\u2019s response seems relevant \u2014the response of a younger, innocent, pre-Troubles Heaney. In \u2018Feeling into Words\u2019, a lecture given in 1974, Heaney explained how he came to write \u2018Requiem for the Croppies\u2019: [The poem] was written in 1966 when most poets in Ireland were straining to celebrate the anniversary of the 1916 Rising. That rising was the harvest of seeds sown in 1798, when revolutionary republican ideals and national feeling coalesced in the doctrines of Irish republicanism and in the rebellion of 1798 itself - unsuccessful and savagely put down. . . . The oblique implication was that the seeds of violent resistance sowed in the Year of Liberty had flowered in what Yeats called \u2018the right rose tree\u2019of 1916. ^ \u2022 (Heaney, Pvrornifmtiong 66) Some of the assumptions here derive from the cliche noted by Tom Dunne. Heaney assumes that you can commemorate one historical event in terms of another; that there was organic con  tinuity (seeds), as well as absolute identity, between 1798 and 1916; that \u2018most poets in Ireland\u2019 were keenly sharpening their nibs; that Yeats unambiguously welcomed \u2018the right rose tree\u2019. In fact \u2018Requiem for the Croppies\u2019 concentrates' on the Wexford rather than the Antrim mode of 1798, thereby omitting the Presbyterian 31 \n￼Revising the Rising contribution, which would have upset seamless and timeless unities: \u2018The priest lay behind ditches with the tramp./A peobf hardly marching . . (my italics). Marianne Elliot has pointed ou that Presbyterian United Irishmen were not all that tolerant o priests, and that secular republicans expected popish superstition to wither away. U r But if Heaney commemorates the Easter Rising by (partially) commemorating 1798, Pearse prepared the way by making the Rising itself a commemoration. He invoked not only Tone, but all previous resistance to British rule, all \u2018the dead generations\u2019. W.I. Thompson, in The Imagination of an Insurrection, sees Pearse as embarked upon a Liebestod: perhaps loving the dead led him to love death, to regard death as the finest tribute to the dead: \u2018the fools, the fools, the fools! - they have left us our Fenian dead\u2019. Pearse, assisted by General Maxwell, passed on a legacy that now includes the hunger strikes and the funeral-culture of west Belfast. But the Rising paid tribute to the past as well as the dead. Was it a back-formation? A pastiche? Why did the Dublin people stare? It is not just that cultural nationalism, whether Yeats\u2019s or Hyde\u2019s, had invested heavily in \u2018the ancient ways\u2019. Some of the leading takers for Irish nationalism have always absorbed it at a certain geographical or historical remove. They set out from locations in the diaspora; from the perspectives of English Romanticism or socialism; from the class-guilt of the Anglo-Irish; from the political guilt of an Ulster Protestant. Such adherents sometimes confuse ancient ways with contemporary actualities. My favourite recent example was Ken Livingstone MP, rebuking the Republic\u2019s government for its minimalist commemoration of 1916. But several participants in the Rising also represented earlier strata, or kitsch versions, of national feeling: Tom Clarke factoring in American Fenianism through the IRB; James Connolly, whose Labour in Irish History (1910) reads more like a work of emigre romance than of Marxist materialism; Constance Markiewicz, whose big-house amateur theatricals may have personified that romance for Connolly. And did back-formations continue, yielding diminishing returns? Was all the self-absorbed isolationism of the Free State really necessary? Is it not appalling to think of Bobby Sands - an authentic \u2018republican rebel\u2019 - 32 \n￼The Rising, the Somme and Irish Memory priijng Leon Uris in Long Kesli? Today, com m em orations unerals multiply upon one another in geometric regression, irse is said to have been abstracted in the Post Office: japs because his imagination did not inhabit tbe present and isponsibililies, but concentrated on keeping faith witli the 't and impressing the future. Never has an insurrection been «deliberately m em orable as well as com m em orative, so pscious of its audience: \u2018Tbey shall be spoken of among their ople\u2019 (Pearse, \u2018The Mother\u2019). Yeats, with a mixture of guilt, torror and envy, understood this poetic and dramatic attention- -cking: \u2018But where can we draw water,\u2019 Said Pearse to Connolly, \u2018When all the wells are parched away? O plain as plain can be There\u2019s nothing but our own red blood Can make a rigbt Rose Tree.\u2019 (\u2018Fhe Rose Tree\u2019) Rather like stage-directors, Pearse and Connolly are represented as planning to pool, and thereby maximize, the historical symbolism available to them: the republican liberty tree, Dark Rosaleen, the blood of patriots and Catholic martyrs. It has often been noted that Pearse\u2019s appetite for martyrdom marks tbe point of elision between his nationalism and his Catholicism. He saw Douglas Hyde as John the Baptist and looked for a messiah: I do not know if the Messiah has yet come, and I am not sure that there will be any visible and personal Messiah in this redemption. The people itself will perhaps be its own Messiah, the people labouring, scourged, crowned with thorns, agonis  ing and dying, to rise again immortal and impassible. . The above passage is quoted by W.I. Thompson in his persuasive psychoanalysis of Pearse as \u2018eliminating his humanity in his remorseless fixation of the will updn martyrdom\u2019 (1 But Thompson also records the extent to which Pearse\u2019s writings 33 \n￼Revising the Rising rehearsed the role and rhetoric that brought him death, not as I \u2018the cost but [as] the reward of sacrificeo j J . Pearse can be j seen as a narcissist performing before the mirror of history. The ] poet\u2019s consciously \u2018noble house of my thought\u2019 prepares its own] reception. The rebel-leader arranges not only his martyrdom but 1 his martyrology. The son anticipates the m other/M ary mourning her lost paragon: Dear Mary, that didst see thy first-born Son Go forth to die amid the scorn of men .... (\u2018A Mother Speaks\u2019) Pearse organising his Pieta resembles a suicide who thinks he will be able to watch everyone being sorry watching him. Everyone, that is, whose cultural program m ing can receive his signals and their continuing transmission. I suspect that even very sympathetic non-Catholics found the symbolism and psychology of the hunger strikes hard to take. It is not only because individuals lack stamina that loyalist hunger strikes have always fizzled out: the gesture also lacks cultural support. Protestantism - and even Anglicanism is low-church in Ireland - eschews iconography, martyrology, mariolatry, saints, Christ on the Cross. In Protestant theology, Pearse\u2019s self-identification with Christ appears more obviously blasphemous. Orange insignia stick to the Old Testament, not only out of savage affinities, but because of the ban on representing the New. As a result, the Protestant equivalent of martyrology is a biblical narrative of persecution (paranoia rather than masochism). Anthony D. Buckley, after analyzing the Old Testament \u2018texts\u2019 behind the \u2018emblems\u2019worn by members of the Black Preceptory, concludes: It would indeed be difficult for a unionist who encountered those stories in detail and in depth in the context of the Black Institution not to recognise a similarity Between the situation of the Ulster Protestant and that of the heroes of the various stories. Like the people of Israel in the land of Canaan, Ulster Protestants have been given, and now occupy, an alien land. The foreigners whose land they occupy are, like the Canaanites, the Midianites, the Philistines and all the others, 34 \n￼'Hie Rising, Ihe Sinniiii\u2019 /mil Irish Mi'moiy herenls of an alien religion. Like Jacob, they steadfastly void marrying the daughters of their enemies. Like tlie eroes of the stories, they lay great stress on loyalty, whether to eir religion or to the crown. pckley\u2019s article is called \u2018God\u2019s Chosen People\u2019. This religious rchetype contrasts with that of the Irish people as Christ. . It also involves a contrast between the verbal and the visual, text and image. Even visual signs themselves are not all read in the same way. Black Preceptory emblems \u2014listed by Buckley as including \u2018gardeners\u2019 tools; a dove with olive branch; Noah\u2019s Ark; a seven-stepped ladder; a skull and crossbones; a burning bush; Moses; Aamn\u2019s rod; two crossed trumpets; a square and compasses. . . .\u2019^Sl£*) \u2014do not yield up their meaning in an encompassing visual experience. They require exegesis, translation \u2014not only for outsiders. And where historical \u2018stories\u2019, rather than their metaphorical surrogates or religious archetypes, are in the foreground, this verbal/visual priority may also hold good. Seamus Heaney, in a lecture called \u2018The Sense of the Past\u2019, reflected on the power of \u2018those images and objects which signify common loyalties and are recognised as emblems of a symbolic, past which also claims to be the historical past >While rocognii^ the dangers that can stem from \u2018idealising images of the political past\u2019, Heaney still feels the cultural lug of pictured scenes like a mass-rock or Wolfe Tone\u2019s profile presiding over \u2018the local AOII hall\u2019. He says: \u2018this image of a noble nature stoically enduring had a deeply formative effect on my notion of the United Irishmen, the 1798 rebellion and the whole tradition of Irish nationalism . . . [this] dream of the past . . . enhanced the learning process even when that process involved the demystification and dismantling of the original image. ere Heaney again seems to be receiving Tone via Pearse and Catholic iconography. Thus he may make an unwarranted cross-cultural leap when he refers to \u2018emblematic scenes such as the mass-rock or Tone in the dock or King William on his charger, or Edward Carson signing the covenant at Belfast City Hall.\u2019. Are the latter scenes \u2018em blem atic\u2019 in quite the same way? Do they evoke the same kind of response? ;tr» \n￼Revising the Rising Belinda Loftus, in Mirrors: William III and Mother Ireland provides a fascinating history of how these two figures have been represented. But in one sense of her title they are not \u2018mirrors\u2019: King Billy originates in history, Mother Ireland in myth, even if both function mythically in history. Heaney makes the same error when he writes that the sovereignty of \u2018an indigenous territorial numen of the whole island . . . call her Mother Ireland . . . has been temporarily usurped or infringed by a new male cult whose founding fathers were Cromwell, William of Orange and Edward Carson\u2019 (I\u2019reofeitfaliuns, 57). Aside from the tactic which assigns all \u2018female\u2019 vulnerability to nationalism and all \u2018masculine\u2019 aggression to unionism, Heaney assumes that unionist politics are totalized in King Billy as nationalist politics in Mother Ireland. When Loftus asked two republican women what Mother Ireland meant to them, they replied \u2018Everything\u2019ll Loftus considers Mother Ireland, despite the problems she xaises for feminism, better \u2018suited to handling the complexities of Irish politics today [than] the simple, clear-cut symbolism of male figures like William III whose fine-art development came to a full stop at the end of the eighteenth century\u2019 (££). ft is also true that loyalist imagery has not diversified much since 1968; whereas, despite their late start in the mural-stakes, republican areas have been adorned with phoenixes, Celtic crosses, Cuchulainn freedom-Iighters, and Bobby Sands as a lark in barbed wire, besides Mother Irelands beckoning to battle and a few daughter-Irelands in battle-dress. One mural consists of a masked and bereted IRA man, a flame, and EASTER 1916. However, the Somme, if not King Billy, may be represented in a visionary m anner: an apocalyptic m ural depicting the battlefield centres on an idealized soldier linked to the heavens by rays of light. Yet in finding the Orange visuals comparatively static or limited, we may yet again not be comparing like with like. Protestant arches and marches function emblematically in the strict sense, not \u2018symbolically\u2019. An emblem is \u2018a silent parable\u2019, a morality, not a mystery like a symbol. As in sixteenth-century emblem-books, the historical narratives on walls and banners are framed by words. And the few images without words also implicitly urge: Rem 1690, No Surrender, This We Will Maintain, Lest We Forget. This Protestant memory-bank links emblem with 36 \n￼The Rising, the Somme and Irish Memory I- selective chronicle. In addition to the larger chronicle from the P;Boyne to the Somme, banners carry, like lares and pennies, the pancestral details of every local lodge. That extraordinary Ifspectacle, the Twelfth of July, must be strangely unconscious of itself as such. Otherwise it would not feature all those 1 uncharismatic portraits of temperance-campaigning clergy. As a Ulster\u2019s Solemn League and Covenant associated the \u2018threatened calamity\u2019 of Home Rule with earlier \u2018days of stress and trial\u2019, so Orange insignia work as reminders which are also warnings. They are not icons, but exempla or history-lessons: a heritage-pack as survival-kit. Republican iconography, on the other hand, merges memory into ^piration. It has yet to enter history as such. Tiocfaidh dr Za/underwrites a visionary symbolism that cannot or need not be spelled out. Not Rem Easter 1916, but the .1 rebel and the eternal flame. Similarly, Protestants march, rather than process or \u2018mass\u2019. They express their territoriality in a martial rhetoric of music and movement which matches King Billy\u2019s prancing charger and pointing sword. In contrast, republican ritual appears to commune with itself: Sinn Fein. Protestants read this self-communion, this indifference to their own insistent rhetorical display, this refusal to notice or argue with unionism, as exclusive and threatening. But iconography too is a rhetoric, albeit one that tries to place itself beyond argument. Similarly, Catholics misread Protestant rhetoric as wholly anti-Catholic, rather than also as inner-directed mnemonic. Thus the two forms of commemorative religio, of cultural defence or maintenance, bypass one another. Ulster Protestants perceive their security as resting on a contract with the British crown. The Anglo-Irish Agreement might have caused less of a frisson if it had been less textual (just as civil rights sit-ins might have got a bit further than marches). Gordon Lucy in The Ulster Covenant waxes lyrical about the language of the Covenant as subsuming a historical community: The Ulster people, seeing a common danger, shared a common bond, an unbreakable determination, which found expression in one document, their Solemn League and Covenant. In its simple bul eloquent phrases Ulster men and women found the expression of their deepest convictions, their deepest loyalties 37 \n￼Revising the Rising and their most fervent hopes for their Inline and that of their Despite the \u2018pictorial' in the hook's title, I.uey's commentary H does not emphasi/e the visual. Later he calls the Covenant I \u2018masterly [in] construction; concise in its wording; I comprehensive in its scope\u2019, and refers to its author as \u2018modern I Ulster\u2019s Thomas Jefferson'' He also points to the Covenant\u2019s I origins in the religious history of Scotland \u2018in the sixteenth and I seventeenth centuries\u2019.**'The Bible and Presbyterian I fundam entalism underlie a docum ent that begins: \u2018Being I convinced in our consciences\u2019, just as Catholic hyperdulia and I transcendentalism underlie a proclamation that believes: I \u2018Ireland, through us, summons her children to her Hag\u2019. The I Covenant, like Pearse\u2019s profile, hung in living-rooms. Paul Fussell calls one of his chapters \u2018Oil What a Literary War\u2019. Nineteenth-century Romanticism, in various conjunctions with If nationalism, had a pervasive effect on twentieth-century wars. But Fussell singles out the chivalric language associated with \u2018Christian self-abnegation (\u201csacrifice\u201d), as^well as with more violent actions of aggression and defence\u2019* l e lists the literary tutors of \u2018this \u201craised\u201d, essentially feudal language\u2019 as \u2018the boys\u2019 books of George Alfred Henty; the male-romances of Rider Haggard; the poems of Robert Bridges; and especially the Arthurian poems of Tennyson and the pseudo-medieval romances of William Morris\u2019 (Fuseli. ■21). No doubt some members of the Ulster Volunteer Force (and of the National Volunteers too) had been exposed to this tutoring, as to the m ore im m ediate w artim e propaganda-effort. However, indigenous religious and political traditions put a further pressure behind \u2018a just war\u2019 and cliches like \u2018staunch\u2019, \u2018heritage\u2019, \u2018liberty1and \u2018loyal\u2019; while Kipling, in his anti-Home Rule poem \u2018Ulster 1912\u2019, had given \u2018sacrifice\u2019 a special gloss: \u2018What need of further lies?/W e are the sacrifice\u2019. Philip Orr, in his illuminating The Road to the Somme, quotes the following verse from the Newtownards Chronicle (12 Septem ber 1914): A hundred years ago your fathers fought As you m ust fight for liberty today. \n￼The Rising, Ihe Somme anti Irish Memory |- Beside that heritage all else was naught. jiv And shall yon prove yourselves less slannrh than they? L The hour has struck, and Britain asks your vow Of loyal and ungrudging service - now! 2©- Perhaps \u2018staunch\u2019 has stayed current only in Ulster (where there seem to be no staunch Catholics or devout Protestants). Ulster/ Irish Catholic rccruitment-figures remain in dispute (and their deaths doubly uncom m em orated N orth and South) because unionist leaders inflated their own followers\u2019 eagerness to join k up. As O rr says, \u2018it was in the Ulster Unionists\u2019 interests to portray Ulstermen as rallying to the Empire\u2019s defence in throngs whilst the mutinous Catholic population sat unmoved and unpatriotic at home\u2019 £>+). Ulster Protestant, participation in the war, later mainly of internal significance, was meant to he remembered in the context of Home Rule. Orr quotes a poem by F.S. Boas which exemplifies a \u2018sense of anticipated contract\u2019 (Orr, 54): The sword half drawn 011 her own behalf In Ulster\u2019s Red Right Hand Will leap from the scabbard and flash like fire For the common Motherland. And wherever the fight is hottest, And the sorest task is set, UISTER WILL STRIKE FOR ENC'.IAND AND F.NGIAND WILL NOT FORGET. Recently Ian Paisley and James Molyneaux revived the outer- directed m nem onic role of U lster\u2019s em battled past - the reminder to Britain - when they personified staunchness during the Gulf War debate at Westminster. Meanwhile the television cameras showed the body-language ofJohn Hume and Seamus Mallon as more slumped than staunch. If not exactly \u2018mutinous\u2019, \n￼Revising the Rising Demythologizing retrospects on World War I developed more slowly in Northern Ireland, where Carson hymned \u2018the gltmy and honour [the dead] had won for the Imperial Province\u2019,^niough \u2018heroes\u2019 returned to find themselves unemployed, and Wilfred Owen and the rest could be read there too. Among the unpublished juvenilia of John Hewitt, already a socialist in the mid-1920s, are attacks on the war\u2019s futility. Despite an early admiration for Connolly in particular, Hewitt was also revising the Rising. He noted after a visit to Dublin in 1928: \u2018The only change wrought by new law \u2014/The pillar-boxes now are green\u2019l Orr observes that by 1936 \u2018homage to the men who had died [at the Somme] was mingled with a preparedness to criticise the military strategy of the leaders and, indeed, the attitude of the ordinary soldiers\u2019 ( j By 1966 a veteran wrote an article for the Belfast Telegraph which said: \u2018we were locked in chains for execution\u2019.a t. Pearse\u2019s mind-set is often compared to Rupert Brooke\u2019s: the association of self-sacrifice with a \u2018cleansing\u2019 or \u2018cleanness\u2019 next to godliness; the parallels between Brooke\u2019s public-school athletic idealism and Pearse\u2019s \u2018devout Catholic\u2019 version of Boy's Own; the vision of noble death as redeeming collective shame; death as a \u2018royal gift\u2019 or \u2018rarer gifts than gold\u2019. Pearse\u2019s poetry shares with Brooke\u2019s patriotic sonnets an inversion - some might say perversion - of normative values. Words and images, more usually mustered for poetic celebrations of life, are turned to the service of death. Brooke calls war \u2018peace\u2019; danger \u2018safety\u2019; death \u2018rich\u2019. Like Pearse, he presents renunciation - of all things earthly, bodily, sensory, hum an - as fulfilment: These laid the world away; poured out the red Sweet wine of youth; gave up the years to be Ofwork andjoy .... (\u2018The Dead\u2019) These had seen movement, and heard music; known Slumber and waking; loved; gone proudly friended. .. . (\u2018The Dead\u2019,II) Pearse\u2019s \u2018Renunciation\u2019 is quicker to mortify the flesh. He lingers less on life in imaginatively taking leave: 1 I 1 j l 40 \n￼The Rising, the Somme and Irish Memory I heard thy music, O melody of melody, And I closed my ears For fear I should falter. ;;The poem\u2019s sequence of sensory self-deprivations resembles the ^masochistic penances undertaken by Stephen Dedalus. Charles Sorley\u2019s sonnet, \u2018When you see millions of the mouthless dead\u2019, written before the Somme, attacks the doctrines of sacrificial inversion and sentimental remembrance: When yon see millions of the mouthless dead Across your dreams in pale battalions go, Say not soft things as other men have said, That you\u2019ll remember. For you need not so. Give them not praise. For, deaf, how should they know It is not Curses heaped on each gashed head? Nor tears. Their blind eyes see not your tears flow. Nor honour. It is easy to be dead. Say only this, \u2018They are dead\u2019. . . . Sorley\u2019s ironical reversals of Brooke\u2019s inversions indicates the element of literary criticism in anti-war poetry. His sonnet also pre-empts the \u2018soft things\u2019 written in remembrance-poems and said at official Remembrance Day ceremonies - ceremonies that ease further deaths. One might also compare \u2018blind eyes\u2019 with Pearse\u2019s \u2018I blinded my eyes\u2019 in \u2018Renunciation\u2019. The literary construction of the Rising, of course, drew heavily on native sources for its \u2018raised\u2019 language and its iconography: the tropes of certain Gaelic poems; Catholic devotional literature; the ballads of Young Ireland. But Yeats had also acted as a catalytic converter of English and European Romantic idioms. His pseudo-Celticism was modelled on Morris\u2019s pseudo-Medieval- ism; Cuchulainn (with a little help from Samuel Ferguson\u2019s Ulster Protestant aggrandisement of mythic heroes) was his answer to Tennyson\u2019s Arthur. Also, Yeats imported the mood of Jin-de-siecle into Ireland: febrile, apocalyptic, prostrated before \u2018forgotten beauty\u2019 symbolized by iconic females. The jin-de-siecle was profoundly Catholic in sensibility: oidy some instinct of \u2018No 41 \n￼its Surrender\u2019 held Yeats back froin the Rome-ward path of Liond^B| Johnson or Maud Gonne. The poetry of Joseph Mary PlunkcttB& (ill, as were so many of Yeats\u2019s \u2018tragic generation\u2019) was® influenced by the English Catholic mystic, Francis Thompson,® and it exemplifies the Catholic-Gaelic \u2014rather than Protestant-9 Celtic - mode of the fin-de-siecle. (Hence the contradiction on* which the Gaelic League eventually impaled Douglas Hyde.) Ilisl poem for Joan of Arc (does the French Catholic-Nationalist poet* Peguy lurk in the background?) begins: \u2018She walks the azure 1 meadows where the stars/Shed glowing petals on her moon- 1 white feet\u2019and concludes with divinely sanctioned war: The battle-ranks of Heaven are marching past Squadron by squadron, battalion, and brigade, Both horse and foot - Soundless their swift parade, Silent till she appears \u2014then quick they cast Upon the wind the banner of the Maid And heaven rocks with Gabriel\u2019s trumpet-blast. Such apocalypse may parallel, rather than imitate, James Clarence Mangan\u2019s vision of Dark Rosaleen with \u2018holy delicate white hands\u2019who inspires the earth to \u2018rock beneath our tread\u2019. Either way, the devotional structure \u2014to which Yeats\u2019s poetry ceased to approximate soon after 1900 - seems a cultural constant. Thomas MacDonagh, of whom W.I. Thompson says \u2018[his] self-image was the tortured soul, his self-myth . . . a Byronism converted to a Christian cause\u2019 (Thomp.'uin,\u2014 wrote a poem to M angan\u2019s grand Byronian soul: \u2018Poor splendid Poet of the burning eyes\u2019. The poem shares the doctrine of Pearse\u2019s \u2018Fool\u2019- that a mad dream may be truest wisdom - and it ends: thy single love Was, in high trust, to hymn thy Gaelic land And passionate proud woes of Roisin Dubh. Where is Ireland-'s tradition of anti-war poetry (until Paul Durcan), for all the Republic\u2019s emphasis on virtuous neutrality? There are obvious historical and political reasons why the Rising could not Revising llic Rising S B 42 \n￼The Rising, the Somme and Irish Memory uated with the Great War\u2019s \u2018futility\u2019. Nonetheless, the Civil 9 if not the Anglo-Irish War, cast the dream into question, e Civil War made it more difficult to believe Irish versions of e old Lie: Dulce et decorum est/Pro patria mori.\u2019 And of se, the brutalities of the European war came home to Ireland ie shape of the Black-and-Tans. In \u2018Nineteen Hundred and jneteen\u2019, Yeats makes a Black-and-Tan atrocity the focus for his Alternation over lost peace and lost hope\u2019. The poem is also a lated World War I poem, and a critique of Orange/British and reen violence. It dates from 1912 the destruction of faith in rinciple and progress: We, who seven years ago, Talked of honour and of truth, Shriek with pleasure if we show The weasel\u2019s twist, the weasel\u2019s tooth. \u2018Meditations in Time of Civil War\u2019 echoes that quatrain, now seeming to date disillusionment from 1916: We had fed the heart on fantasies, The heart\u2019s grown brutal from the fare; More substance in our enmities Than in our love .... The Civil War has not yet fully emerged from a traumatized silence. Many participants, like veterans of the Great War, simply refused to say anything about it (there are numerous family testimonies to this). As Wilfred Owen asked: \u2018Why speak they not of comrades that went under?\u2019 Owen, while his own poetry kept on speaking, knew that silences do not mark only the place where enormity seems beyond words: they mark the place where cultures are thrown into extreme psychic confusion. The end of \u2018Meditations in Time of Civil War\u2019 bitterly echoes the Utopian apocalypses of the Jin-de-siecle as it dramatizes the \u2018senseless tumult\u2019 that created the trauma: The rage-driven, rage-tormented, and rage-hungry troop, Trooper belabouring trooper, biting at arm or at face, 43 \n￼Revising the Rising Plunges towards nothing, arms and lingers spreading wide For the embrace of nothing: and I, my wits astray Because of all that senseless tumult, all but cried For vengeance on tbe murderers ofJacques Molay. \"Ik5*^ Perhaps not until Brendan Kennedy (Cromwell,Rudas) and Paul Durcan (Daddy, Daddy) did poetry in the Republic really begin to confront the psychic fall-out of political \u2018fantasies\u2019. But Eoin MacNeill, before the Rising he tried to stop, had already psycho  analyzed it as \u2018impelled by a sense of feebleness or despondency or fatalism or by an instinct of satisfying their emotions or escap  ing from a difficult and complex and trying situation\u2019 (qifffi-cd bv Thompson itH PF) For the last twenty-three years Northern Irish poetry, like Northern Irish society, has found itself back in that \u2018difficult and complex and trying situation\u2019 - a return of the repressed, which can be resolved neither by paramilitary sublimation nor by the politics of com m em oration. W hen poetry engages with the vocabularies, emblems and icons that condition this fresh outbreak of war, it has evidently absorbed the precedents of Yeats, Owen, Rosenberg and others: literary models bound in with historical origins. For instance, Tom Paulin has satirised the ugly, neo-imperial \u2018old lies\u2019 which unionism still parades, and Michael Longley has redirected the Great War protest-elegy in circumstances where futile deaths raise even more difficult issues. His poem \u2018The War Poets\u2019 obliquely links Northern Irish poets with the dead \u2018soldier-poets\u2019 for whom the armistice never comes: It was rushes of air that took the breath away As though curtains were suddenly drawn aside And darkness streamed into the dormitory Where everybody talked about the war ending And always it would be the last week of the war. Paul Muldoon\u2019s \u2018Aisling\u2019 revises the Rising by asking whether Cathleen ni Houlihan, inspirer of hunger strikes, should be renamed \u2018Anorexia, who left/a lemon stain on my flannel sheet\u2019. Another poem, \u2018Anseo\u2019, probes the psychology, rather than the 44 \n￼rhr Rising, the Somme and Irish Memory ideology, of Northern nationalism. A delinquent schoolboy is trained by his \u2018Master\u2019 to fetch from the hedge \u2018A stick with which he would be beaten\u2019. This parable of cultural sado  masochism, of a self-scourged people, ends with the victim becoming authoritarian in his turn: as a guerilla-leader \u2018fighting for Ireland\u2019. Muldoon suggests another way in which the boy has been programmed for such a destiny, since he bears the com  memorative name: Joseph Mary Plunkett Ward. Northern Irish poetry, in so far as it can be called meditations in time of civil war, addresses tbe literary and political complexity it has inherited, by working very close to the grain of language and image. The local pathologies demand from poets the precision of a bomb-disposal team: delicate dismantling which is also a matter of life and death. Perhaps it all started with Yeats revising Thomas Davis. Yeats\u2019s early aesthetic challenge to Davis\u2019s language (\u2018worn down to mere abstraction by perpetual mechanical use ) reached a literary- political culmination in \u2018Easter 1916\u2019. It was Davis who mass- produced the nationalist rhetorical strategy of commemoration: On Fontenoy, on Fontenoy, like eagles in the sun With bloody plumes the Irish stand \u2014the field is longht and won! For often, in O\u2019Connor\u2019sVan To triumph dash\u2019d each Connaught clan .... Yet in adapting the devices of nineteenth-century English patriotic verse, Davis may have been more akin to emblem- minded Orangemen than to the deep symbolic penetration of Mangan. Yeats termed the songs and ballads a \u2018rhymed lesson- book\u2019. Davis invoked a vigorous past to promote action in the present, not so that the dead generations might be venerated for their own sake. The nostalgic mantras of Thomas Moore, them  selves in tune with some Gaelic poetic structures, influenced the\u2018 Catholic-nationalist reception of Davis\u2019s work. Thus Davis may have been partly misread by Pearse\u2019s commemorative Rising. Yeats\u2019s 1916 poems are not straightforward commemorations, but reflections on commemoration: on symbol, word and 45 \n￼Revising the Rising memory. They exploit and achieve ballad-memorability, yet I frustrate the notion that rem em bering the Rising will be a simple I matter. In the very form of his poem, Yeats criticizes Pearse\u2019s iconography as Sorley criticises Brooke\u2019s \u2018raised\u2019 language. Refrains particularly carry, or intensify, poetic memorability. Tbey drive home Davis\u2019s history-lessons, and perhaps the idea that Irish history merely repeats itself. If \u2018Easter 1916\u2019 were an orthodox Young Ireland ballad, it would not have an ambiguity as its main refrain: \u2018A terrible beauty is born\u2019. What should have been the refrain - commemoration of the dead leaders - is postponed until the last moment and thereby qualified. Also, at the end of the third stanza Yeats denies us the expected refrain. Instead we get \u2018The stone\u2019s in the midst of all\u2019. Stone, for Yeats, signifies dogma, the dorcd mind, \u2018Hearts with one purpose alone\u2019*fte contrasts the stone with another image, \u2018the living stream\u2019, which signifies the flux of life and history. By imitating this flux, the movement of \u2018Easter 1916\u2019 subverts the stony predetermined repetitions of the Davisite ballad: The horse that comes from the road, The rider, the birds that range From cloud to tumbling cloud, Minute by minute they change .... The paradox here is that the rebels who have changed everything remain unchanging - not only through their deaths and trans  figuration. Yeats\u2019s rhythms, shuttling the same word into different slots, undermine this fixity: \u2018Minute by minute they change . . . \u2018Changes minute by minute . . . Minute by minute they live (my italics). The pulse of the lines breaks out of the mausoleum imposed by Pearse\u2019s belief that \u2018life springs from death\u2019. Yeats\u2019s 1916 poems admit that symbolic action - the rose tree, \u2018MacDonagh\u2019s bony thumb\u2019 - has proved more potent than \u2018politic words\u2019. Pearse\u2019s bad poetry has made something happen. Yet in \u2018Easter 1916\u2019 the fluidity of Yeats\u2019s own medium, its meta  phoric and metamorphic powers, suggests that the nationalist icon may stand still, while \u2018the living stream\u2019 moves on. (The same, of course, applies to the frozen historical emblems of Ulster unionism.) It might also be said that words argue with symbol by 'Hi \n￼The Rising, the Somme and Irish Memory proving themselves more flexible. \u2018Easter 1916\u2019 at once makes the Davisite tradition, and breaks it. Today, Yeats\u2019s \u2018living stream\u2019 might represent the last seventy-five years and Southern revisionism, while his \u2018stone\u2019 might represent either Northern republicanism or \u2018Reclaim the Spirit of 1916\u2019. \u2018Easter 1916\u2019 is, in fact, the first work of revisionist poetry, revisionist history, revisionist literary criticism. But the poem involves a double revisionism, a revisionist double-take, successive \u2018changes\u2019 in perspective. The speaker acknowledges that he has been a sceptic of the kind that Brendan Bradshaw now deplores. On meeting nationalist idealists, he \u2018thought before I had done/O f a mocking tale or a gibe\u2019. But the Rising has forced him to see tragedy, \u2018terrible beauty\u2019, where formerly he saw comedy, and to see men and women he had criticized as \u2018transformed utterly\u2019. But the second pair of stanzas has second thoughts about that transformation. After mediating on stream and stone, the poem proceeds to revisionist questions which still hang in the air: \u2018Was it needless death after all?\u2019 \u2018And what if excess of love/Bewildered them till they died?\u2019 \u2018Excess of love\u2019 was Pearse\u2019s own phrase and \u2018bewilder\u2019, with its hint of the irrational or neurotic, echoes Eoin MacNeill\u2019s doubts. Yet this does not detract from the tragic dignity with which the names \u2018MacDonagh and MacBride/And Connolly and Pearse\u2019 are ultimately invested. \u2018Easter 1916\u2019, in so finely balancing tribute and question, might be a model for revisionism without devaluation. Tread softly because you tread on my myths. Reclaiming the spirit of 1916 indeed appears to be a religious project. The Reverend Brendan Bradshaw depicts himself as crying in the wilderness against \u2018a sceptical empiricism [which] resulted in sterile rednctionism \u2019^ ee lire Thought rrr'h d and, supplem ent to Fortnight 397, 17 18). Meanwhile he depicts his opponents as a monolithic group, a conspiracy, of historians, called \u2018the revisionists\u2019, who have extracted the heroism, tragedy and \u2018play of national consciousness\u2019 from Irish history. Bradshaw\u2019s own studies, on the other hand, have led him to reinstate \u2018the popular perception of Irish history as a struggle for the liberation of \u201cfaith and fatherland\u201d from the oppression of the Protestant English.\u2019^iffle appears to be fighting the Reformation as much as revisionism.) If Bradshaw seeks to make nationalist doctrines absolute and sacrosanct again, others have endorsed the 47 \n￼»6lU rcf«a $ redemptive function of 1916 - an endorsement which logically implies that redemptive politics did not work first time round. In Dermot Bolger\u2019s symposium 16 on 16, Anthony Cronin says we are \u2018a craven people but craven before our own gods\u2019, and Francis Stuart calls the 1916 leaders \u2018people of one\u2019s race whose memra-y redeems some of the shame that race has brought on it since\u2019. Elsewhere (\u20181916 \u2014Goodby&-to-allJthax21-/mv!»-4^wF^-2, 1991, 6-8)\u201d*Robert Ballagh, one of the reclaimers, contrasts \u2018the vision and self-sacrifice of the men and women who participated in the rising\u2019 with \u2018the poverty of spirit [ancjj narrow-minded, self-seeking attitudes\u2019 in contemporary IrelancrTor Ballagh, the spirit of 1916 denotes a kind of shock-therapy, which could transform the Republic\u2019s \u2018catalepsy\u2019, \u2018stupor\u2019, and \u2018miasma of mediocrity\u2019. It seems dangerous, even fascistic, to dream of a golden moment in the past which might dissolve the ills of the present. (How ironical that Ballagh\u2019s article should take its title from Robert Graves\u2019s demythologizing memoir of the Great War.) To desire Pearse\u2019s Second Coming is to shirk the tough problems of contemporary politics. It is to escape - into commemoration - \u2018from a difficult and complex and trying situation\u2019. A baying, witch-hunting, heretic-hunting note sometimes enters these anti-revisionist calls. Among the targets are: \u2018academics\u2019, \u2018status-seekers\u2019 with \u2018expensive residences\u2019, \u2018media pundits\u2019, \u2018bourgeois shoneens\u2019, \u2018West Britons\u2019, \u2018foreign dross\u2019 and \u2018the serried ranks of the Southern establishment\u2019. It is no apostasy to treat Pearse and Co. as historical figures rather than as saints; to set the Rising in its early twentieth-century contexts; to demystify its transcendental permanence. Equally, Ulster Protestants will need to accept that texts and covenants can become slippery in the living stream of history. It is no good shouting \u2018I.undy\u2019 at the Anglo-Irish Agreement while the people perish and \u2018conscience\u2019 withers. The spirits of 1912 and 1916 froze all kinds of energy, diversity and possibility. The Bewolu- \u2018talkn\u2019 FAuiiplilitd their mutually paralysing effect in the North.

Introducing \u2018Belfast: A Poem, Descriptive and Tributary\u2019,Lyons was\u2018aware that the subject which [the author) has undertaken is very extensive, and one in which it is impossible for him to meet the wishes of all; nay, in fact it might admit of a continuation to much larger bounds than he has at present prescribed\u2019.1 However, at the risk of crass generalization, I decided to opt for a broad canvas. As with politics, so with literature: if you pull out one thread of the Belfast tangle, others tug in opposition. My main purpose is to survey the vision of Belfast presented in some twentieth-century fiction and poetry, including work by St. John Ervine, Michael McL.averty, Sam Hanna Bell, Brian Moore, Louis MacNeice, John Hewitt, Seamus Heaney and Derek Mahon. I shall also briefly mention several other writers in order to fill out the Joycean issue of whether the \u2018conscience\u2019of the city has been imaginatively created. Again, I shall occasionally look at this \u2018writer and city\u2019question from the alternative viewpoint: not \u2018Belfast in Literature\u2019 but \u2018Literature in Belfast\u2019. (The obviously relevant matter of the theatre lies outside my scope.) As regards \u2018Literature in Belfast\u2019, Belfast\u2019s image, through most of its history, has combined Philistia with its other possible aspects as \u2018Bigots-borough\u2019 (James Douglas\u2019s coinage)2 or Cokestown- across-the-water. The narrator of George Birmingham\u2019s The Red Hand o f Ulster, himself a \u2018p e e r . . . wit h a taste for literature\u2019,3offers a conventional analysis: \u2018Belfast - perhaps because of the religious atmosphere of the city, perhaps because of the interest taken by its inhabitants in money-making - has not given to the world many eminent poets, philosophers or scholars\u2019.4This may not have been quite accurate in 1912: it\u2019s even less accurate now. But E.M. Forster\u2019s obituary of Forrest Reid in 1947 saw him as exceptional: \u2018He was the most important person in Belfast, and ... I have sometimes smiled to think how little that great city, engaged in its own ponderous purposes, dreamed of him or indeed of anything\u2019.5 Derek Mahon in 1964 still considered the city impervious to dreams. 65 \n￼66 The Irish Writer and the City He published in the TCD magazine Icarus, the first version of his important poem \u2018In Belfast\u2019. The last stanza, since wholly revised, then commanded ironically: Poetry and fluent drivel, know your place - Take shape in some more glib environment Away from shipyard gantry, bolt and rivet. Elsewhere assess existence; ask to what end It tends, wherefore and why. In Belfast live it.c There was of course Belfast\u2019s fabled Athenian age, of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, vividly reflected in The Drennan Letters. However the picture painted by Mrs. McTier, William Drennan\u2019s lively sister, is not always rosy. She refers in 1807 to \u2018the talk and puffing of that taste for the fine arts which was said to have arisen here\u2019.7 Yet Mrs McTier\u2019s own critical powers seem a mark of high civilisation. For instance, of Mrs. Siddons\u2019s second visit to Belfast (in 1805) she remarks: \u2018[Mrs Siddons] is grown very large, which is not inconsistent with the sublime, though it detracts from the beautiful\u2019.8But, in the words of Denis Ireland\u2019sessay, \u2018Smoke Clouds in the Lagan Valley\u2019: \u2018The little Georgian town on the Lagan\u2019was to be \u2018smothered by Victorianism and the Manchester School\u2019.9 Commercial and scientific materialism, together with the puritanical evangelism let loose by the \u2018Year of Grace\u2019(1859), drove literature underground. Poetry was published psuedonymously or post  humously. Already Thackeray in 1842 had found the bookshops full of \u2018portraits of reverend gentlemen\u2019, whereas the \u2018poor neglected Dramatic Muse of Ulster hid herself.10Samuel Ferguson had taken his characteristically Belfast energies to Dublin, becoming one of those \u2018invisible exports\u2019, self-exiled writers, much lamented by John Hewitt and John Boyd in articles during the 1940\u2019s and early 50\u2019s. I The export list includes Joseph Campbell, St. John Ervine, George Birmingham, Louis MacNeice, W.R. Rodgers, Brian Moore, Seamus Heaney and Derek Mahon. Rodgers complained in 1941 of being\u2018schooled in a backwater of literature out of sight of the running stream of contemporary verse.\u201911John Hewitt, a stayer, sums up the problem in \u2018The Bitter Gourd\u2019: \u2018The Ulster ideology . . .offered the writer no inspiration. The Ulster public offered him no livelihood.\u201911 While advocating rootedness and regionalism, Hewitt has to admit: \u2018It is only in recent years that minds of even a moderate sensitivity have been able to endure and remain\u2019.13 So while both Ulster and \n￼The Writer and Belfast 67 Belfast have produced numerous writers, Belfast, their natural metropolis, has often in the past sped them through the double swing-doors to Dublin or London and beyond. Of course Belfast\u2019s inhospitality to writers may have operated in a vicious circle to reinforce the unfavourable aspects of its literary image. (John Milton unwittingly set a trend by calling the place \u2018a barbarous nook\u2019, sight unseen, in reaction to the utterances of its Presbyters.)14 I collected some adjectives which convey the force of that mutual rejection: Michael McLaverty\u2019s recurrent \u2018desolate\u2019, MacNeice\u2019s \u2018hard\u2019, \u2018cold\u2019, \u2018melancholy\u2019, \u2018lurid\u2019 (in his poem \u2018Belfast\u2019). John Montague packs into the first stanza of The Rough Field \u2018iron bleakness\u2019, \u2018narrow huckster streets\u2019, \u2018stern\u2019, \u2018dour, despoiled\u2019, \u2018shabby\u2019 and \u2018grimy\u2019.15 And of course Brian Moore\u2019s fusillade of \u2018run-down\u2019, \u2018provincial\u2019, \u2018grey\u2019, \u2018black\u2019, \u2018ugly\u2019, \u2018dull\u2019, \u2018dead\u2019. Sometimes, especially in recent thrillers, all this acquires an exotic tinge, as of \u2018down these mean streets a man must go\u2019. But the blackest picture of all appears in a novel by M.F. Caulfield, actually called The Black City. The first paragraphs explain: It is the Black City because of what is between Protestant and Catholic, between mongrel Briton and mongrel Irishman, that is, narrow hatred and bigotry. It is not much of a place as cities go, a nineteenth-century industrial profusion of shipyard gantries, linen-mills, factory chimneys, flaking pubs, oily river basins and mile after mile of narrow, mean streets. . . It isan awfully wet place. The wettest place on earth . . .The rain . . . persists all day almost everyday. It clogs the streets, mixes with the dust to create a fine, gluey mud that adheres to everything.1B The Black City is a serious, if melodramatic and impressionistic, study of sectarian violence. But that opening, and the adjectives quoted earlier, suggest the high degree of pathetic fallacy that obtains in writing about Belfast. (\u2018The inevitable rain\u2019, for instance, often accompaniesthefrustrationsofBrian Moore\u2019scharacters).17Forrest Reid\u2019sbeloved quotation \u2018Tout paysage est un etat d\u2019ame\u2019overstates the case, though should be kept in mind.1\" Yet it does not always rain in the literature of Belfast, or in Belfast itself.
