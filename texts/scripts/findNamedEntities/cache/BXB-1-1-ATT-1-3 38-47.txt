The gig has been organised at very short notice by the Winnipeg Folk Festival; as far as I can tell, the publicity consists of a box ad in the hotel restaurant menu and a couple of leaflets shoved between the Grate  ful Dead albums in the local second-hand record store. There is a two-dollar admission charge, waived for anyone staying at or enter  taining in the hotel. The majority of the audience consists of businessmen; corporate males, each with one of those little cardboard identification badges which middle-aged executives wear in lieu of personalities when they go to business functions in hotels. They are all rather drunk, and obviously under the impression that Attila the Stockbroker is some kind of country and western act. There\u2019s a smattering of Folk Club regulars, mostly Woodstock survivors and Man sweater victims, and, to my pleasure and sur  prise, a group of ten or so who look like punks and show every sign of interest - in fact virtually all of them come up to me individually during the course of the evening and ask me why the hell Pm play  ing at a country and western club instead of the local anarcho-veggie commune, and will I come and play for them there after Pve been booed off? At the appointed hour I take the stage. Directly front of me, and seemingly obliviousJSrmy presence, four gentlenyftt of the wrist talk corporate gunk - their lapel badges indicating an umbilical allegiance to a local computer firm. Summoning up all my consider  able energy reserves, I launch into an extra loud, extra fast version of \u2018Libyan Students From Hell\u2019 and await the onslaught. An hour and a half and three encores later, I leave the stage - very worried. 38 \n￼Attila 3 -47 18/9/92 12:46 am Page 39. e Australia I\u2019m not much one for snapshots, though the world is now my oyster I chronicle my wanderings in poem and in song But when I went Down Under, I brought along my camera to photograph the wildlife, that rich and teeming throng On my first few days in Oz, I wasn\u2019t sure that they existed - those strange, exotic species, they mostly hide away $ >ut on the way to Melbourne the truth became apparent; if you want to see some wildlife, then take the motorway...
