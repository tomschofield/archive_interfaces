Even at daybreak green swathes of light flickered incessantly against the sky and into our dull room. Headlamps along the highway beamed into walls of rainfall and across the Missouri river billows o f smoky downpour wandered away over Iowa. It was a day like other days, a Tuesday morning and work spreading its routines and rumbling on: every' driver behind the dark holes the wipers evenly made in the windshield\u2019s skin of wet was stuck there in his Tuesday morning seat and going all out whereyTuesday took him.

Ov'cT 15 vfyJ \n￼1 New Orleans The moon hangs like the last cantaloupe <Kj on the market, in its net of cloud. Even at this small hour there will be some slung yet over quiet traders down that end of town.

Out further, in the wide reaches o f darkness, police-cars howl like sad cats and forage among shadows. There is a blood-scent on the grid. No night can be different. Later, the moon slips from its net and lifts, brightens into a white dominance, and pulls what could be hope, what feels like hope, necessary' neutral illumination, along the glittering and enormous river. 16 f ","docTitle":"","docDate":"2014-07-01 09:46:54.069"},"meta":{"contentType":"text/raw","emVer":"7.1.1103.5","langIdVer":"DefaultLangId","processingVer":"CalaisJob01","submissionDate":"2014-07-01 09:46:53.804","submitterCode":"57b17a53-6e34-87b0-20ff-a419896f49c9","signature":"digestalg-1|MpG+iljrXyg7lDZvLNXrNzX8cCI=|fl0n5Q+kc2anxKZNPI/SzbU1A3g0JgrYw9tQ7Z9ynRCHls7fVXo52w==","language":"English"}},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/d12926ba-943a-35d4-909c-5035fc299255/cat/1":{"_typeGroup":"topics","category":"http://d.opencalais.com/cat/Calais/Hospitality_Recreation","classifierName":"Calais","categoryName":"Hospitality_Recreation","score":0.772},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/d12926ba-943a-35d4-909c-5035fc299255/cat/2":{"_typeGroup":"topics","category":"http://d.opencalais.com/cat/Calais/Environment","classifierName":"Calais","categoryName":"Environment","score":0.606},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/d12926ba-943a-35d4-909c-5035fc299255/lid/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http://d.opencalais.com/lid/DefaultLangId/English"},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/4855a040-c0bb-3518-86ea-295b22fbd357":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"NaturalFeature","name":"Missouri river","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/NaturalFeature","instances":[{"detection":"[ highway beamed into walls of rainfall and across ]the Missouri river[ billows o f smoky downpour wandered away over]","prefix":" highway beamed into walls of rainfall and across ","exact":"the Missouri river","suffix":" billows o f smoky downpour wandered away over","offset":249,"length":18}],"relevance":0.355},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/4b59c1ad-8092-34d5-b763-a43226a1836c":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"ProvinceOrState","name":"Missouri","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/ProvinceOrState","instances":[{"detection":"[beamed into walls of rainfall and across the ]Missouri[ river billows o f smoky downpour wandered away]","prefix":"beamed into walls of rainfall and across the ","exact":"Missouri","suffix":" river billows o f smoky downpour wandered away","offset":253,"length":8}],"relevance":0.355,"resolutions":[{"id":"http://d.opencalais.com/er/geo/provinceorstate/ralg-geo1/22a2e9d4-42cf-58a2-d8d3-3269b69ad67a","name":"Missouri,United States","shortname":"Missouri","containedbycountry":"United States","latitude":"38.5","longitude":"-92.5"}]},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/1787db7a-17ee-3137-a565-3c55d743c1d2":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"City","name":"New Orleans","resolutions":[{"id":"http://d.opencalais.com/er/geo/city/ralg-geo1/7f2145a4-587a-b325-469c-f92b2bcdf9d3","name":"New Orleans,Louisiana,Louisiana","shortname":"New Orleans","containedbystate":"Louisiana","containedbycountry":"Louisiana","latitude":"29.9728","longitude":"-90.059"}],"_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/City","instances":[{"detection":"[a ridiculous minute defiance.
