I suddenly start to probe bushes for camouflage, envisage eyes from secret cameras clocking me, sweat on my pale hands, then to make matters worse we\u2019re flagged down by a jeep, rows of guns. I can barely make out a nervous youngster\u2019s face peering out from sandbags in the border pill box. Each day he learns to livejvith shits & shivers, the near-certainty of snipier\u2019)bullets - they harden to it - they grow arrogant as the censor ersing History substituting a very British form of truth. Take for instance this cheeky cockney on the bus, eyeing up bags on racks, beneath the seats. Training his stare on my shaking face contempt spreads as when he thinks of vomit. He seizes up mutiny in our faces & I witness hate - if I had the guts, which I don\u2019t, I\u2019d spit consider fields & cattle worth prison, or fighting for... * \u2022 n^f ^ ^ f -e- 65 \n￼^ 1A ir0j j f i Cleary 53-80 13/7/93 7:03 pm Page 66 - World View I don\u2019t claim to come from anyplace, ideally speaking I\u2019m a World Citizen, sure saying so has got me in shtuck. At Stranraer when the plain clothes boys stopped me, turning out my pockets but I was clean & they were empty & they asked me if I smoked & rifled through my roll-ups; one cheeky fucker lifted my dreadlocks up, made snide comments. So when they asked me on their forms if I was Irish or British, I answered \u2018World Citizen\u2019 & they threatened to strip me hok^il & they hoiked through the 3 cases I was trailing home from Saltbum. \u2018An unemployed World Citizen, you\u2019re some boy\u2019, one joker taunted & in the carpark later my mother was disgusted as still half-cut from the clatter of pints on the ferry, I raised my voice, excited, \u2018Someone has to stand up & be counted\u2019, but I never did, nor will I, & my mother said \u2018aye, you\u2019re a big boy now & know it all\u2019 I suppose I thought I did but now I don\u2019t. I\u2019m ignorant... 66 \n￼Cleary 53-80 13/7/93 7:03 pm Page 67 o - Down South The day Derm drove me down south was a hoot, smashed out of our brains on bump roads & him pretending to be some heavy Ulsterman complaining about potholes & Galtee cheese, creeping Jesus statues everywhere in sight. It had been sunny in Belfast but by the border on the incline of a hill he poked me, \u2018There it is!\u2019 he said, \u2018the grey mist!\u2019 \u2018Why forsake the blue skies of Ulster for the grey mists of the Irish Republic?\u2019 We\u2019d been pulled in & frisked in Armagh & Ed Koch was in town, propegangering. At the cathedral Derm used his wide-angle lens, held high over the top of preying pressmen. I\u2019ve seen the snap since, Ed looks worried, the way anyone would considering gunmen. A Bishop was swanning about & this priest I\u2019d asked directions from pointed him out - \u2018That\u2019s the most powerful clergyman in Ireland!\u2019 so Derm fiddled with his bag, whipped out his camera, said \u2018He must be worth a shot, d\u2019ye reckon?\u2019 & that priest looked just like Ed had, alarmed at how easy it would be & though helioptors_ _ would probably spot ye, you could dram the breath from anyone, just like that! So they pulled us, RUC, job, but we weren\u2019t the hurtful kind, they knew it, just tourists. © 67 \n￼Cleary 53-80 13/7/93 7:04 pm Page 68 I feel like that amid all the roadsigns in gaelic & I\u2019m not surprised after he dropped me off Derm got more grief from a patrol over the border & Bernard my host leaned over to me in \u2018The Black Kesh\u2019, asked me how long I\u2019d lived in England for & when I told him, out of mischief he added \u2018thought there was a trace of West Brit in yer accent\u2019... 68 & -CD- \n￼Cleary 53-80 13/7/93 7:04 pm Page 69 Ulster: A Tourist Guide Now when I return less with the latest gadgets, with more than a sliver of saxon on my tongue, I feel conspicuous like a tourist or being a \u2018trendy leftie\u2019 I become a crack reporter on an undercover expose. My judgements click together now in newsreel, the TV map of Belfast glowing, hangs on my brain & because I\u2019m an alien now & usually stoned & rootless all the bombs & guns & bible thumping scare me more. Men I grew amongst, who never caught the ferry out, on my casual strolls hold sten guns to my throat. As a child I\u2019d practise jumping hedges with cars in pursuit, now it\u2019s no joke, I may have to take a frantic leap & the roadblocks leave me shuddering as my new friends would, all my drinking cronies in the gardens of English pubs. Let\u2019s just say one wants to take his \u2018wife & kid\u2019 over, he\u2019s heard me often recommend the crack, the drink, the fishing & I would have reassured him once, strenuously too, told him to \u2018go for it\u2019, not to bother changing number plates, Ji ■klr-eJ told him to get wire^ iit»to the authentic bars I immortalise, told him sure you could/get a bullet in the head anywhere. ^ x h' /\"/ ,J r ^ h V ^ ^ u.
