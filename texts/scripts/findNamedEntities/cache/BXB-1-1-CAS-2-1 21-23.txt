So the vital must take cover, Deeply away from the sun And the other raptors that hover And swing in ferocious light, down To investigate the dark And its multiple promises, never i jFinal in all its windings, nor Stark, nor positive. The dead river World, so absolute, so clear, Should recommend the dark. >/ /vu<n/e \n￼Boulder City In late afternoon the sun has begun its drop. There are shadows now, precise as black paint. Not even a flurry of dust moves not even a hint of cirrus. The thermometer stands thirteen. Easterners settle here out of the river fogs and the greening rain. Their sprawled houses are silent beside the blue geometry of their deserted pools. That water now must be fit to simmer a chicken. Indoors these pioneers lie low in the blast of the air-conditioning. Should they step from home the sun will lean on their skulls like a ton of fire. 22 / f \n￼Sea Lions off Monterey Tfalf a mile into the Pacific a rock like the back of a sea-beast humps itself out; the swell sounds hollowly as it bumps the sides even in slack water, the sides the only bits visible under the sea lions crowding the top, still, mostly, as clusters of mussels. On shore round the coin-op telescope the children bounce and wrangle, and the cars slide down to the shore and slide away again. An encounter on the edge of things, the sea\u2019s curled lip, the end of a continent, the abounding other, leaving noting to be said. * The still, head-up animals stare indifferently out of the ocean.
