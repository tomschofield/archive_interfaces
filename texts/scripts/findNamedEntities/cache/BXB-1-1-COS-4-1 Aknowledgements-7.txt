Dedication for Judy t \n￼bdd \n￼V«* FERRET More vicious than stoat or weasel because caged, kept hungry, the ferrets were let out only for the kill: an alternative to sulphur and nets. Once one, badly mauled, hid behind a treacle-barrel in the shed. Throwing me back, Matthew slid the door shut. From outside the window, 1 watched. He stood holding an axe, with no gloves. Then it Sprang: and his sleeves were drenched in blood O*! \\o won on the sabbath. A Clydesdale to him was not bells and sugar or declension from paddock, but primal extension s. .Q lyrical stages. He held cardinal sin was misuse of horses, then any game TODdS 1 ul<L^lC My father\u2019s white uncle became D arthritic and testamental in of rock and soil. Thundered nail turned to sacred bolt. And each night in the stable he would slaver and slave at cracked hooves, or else save bowls of porridge for just the right beast. I remember 1lied to him once, about oats: then 1 felt the brand of his loving tongue, the belt of his own horsey breath. But he died, when the mechanised tractor came to pass. Now I think of him neighing to some saint in a simple heaven or, beyond complaint, leaning across a fence and munching grass. where the teeth had sunk. I hear its high-pitched squeal, the clamp of its neat steel jaws. And 1remember how the axe flashed, severing the ferret's head, and how its body kept battering the barrels, long after it was dead. \n￼FARM 1 The sun drills the shire through and through till the farm is a furnace, the yard a quivering wickerwork of flame. Pitchforks rise and fall, bales are fiery ingots. Straws sputter like squibs. Stones explode. From the byre, smack on time, old Martha comes clattering out with buttered bannocks and milk in a pail. Todd, his face ablaze, swims back in what shadow there is. Hugh and John stretch out among sheaves. Hens squabble for crusts; a dog flicks its tail at a cleg; blueflies bunch like grapes. Still the sun beats down, a hammer on tin. And high overhead vapour-trails drift seaward, out past Ailsa Craig. f \nHA RELAW ￼Ploughlands roll where limekilms lay seeping in craters. Where once dense fibres oozed against gatepost and fence till staples burst, firm wheatfields sway; and where quarries reeked, intense with honeysuckle, a truck dumps load upon load of earth, of ash and slag for the raking. Spliced hawsers drag roots out and w'rench the rabbit wood apart as though some cuckoo fugue had rioted. On this mossy slope that raindrops used to drill and drum through dusk, no nightjar Hits nor numb hawk hangs as listening foxes lope and prowl; no lilac shadows thumb the heavy air. This holt was mine to seige and plunder, here I caged rare beasts or swayed royally on the aged backs of horses - here hacked my secret sign, strode, wallowed, ferreted, rampaged. But acres crumple and the farm\u2019s new image spreads over the old. As 1 face its change, a truck tips litter; hens assess bright tins, then peck and squawk their rage. The truck spurts flame and 1 have no redress. COUNTRY DANCE Before the advent of the combine the big mill would lumber from farm to farm, spouting steam and flame; stooks extending to the horizon and beyond, weathered by sun or rain. Intricate as a dance, was the tying of the sheaves, on the ground or against one thigh, to a communal rhythm; then their hoisting in'the stackyard, forks flashing; and as though riding on air, the man on top, under steady bombardment, circling and weaving, gold ramparts rising round him to a music compelling as any eightsome. \n￼AYRSHIRE FARM Every new year\u2019s morning the farmers would meet at Harelaw with their guns for the shoot. Mungo red in the face, Matthew hale as a tree, John huge in old leather. The others in dribs and drabs, shotguns over their shoulders, bags flopping at their sides, collars up. We\u2019d set out across the north park, the glaur on our leggings freezing as we left the shelter of the knowes. No dogs. Even the ferrets on this day of days left squealing behind their wire. We\u2019d fan out, taking the slope at a steady tramp. Mungo always aimed first, blasting away at nothing. Hugh cursed under his breath; the rest of us kept going. Suddenly the hares would rise from the bracken-clumps and go looping uphill. 1remember the banks alive with scuts, the dead gorse-tufts splattered with shot. \n￼5 One by one the haversacks filled, the blood dripping from them, staining the snow. Matthew still in front, directing the others; the sun red behind its dyke, the wind rising. And myself bringing up the rear, pretending I was lost, become the quarry. Three blasts on a whistle, the second time round. And in from the sleet, we would settle on bales with bottles and flasks, to divide the spoils. The bodies slit, and hung on hooks to drip. The rest thrown smoking on the midden. The dogs scrabbling at their chains, Todd\u2019s stallion rearing at the reek of blood. Then in to the fire and a roaring new year: Old Martha and Mima scuffling to and fro, our men\u2019s bellies filling, hands slowly thawing. And for me, off to bed, a pig in the sheets, the oil lamp throwing shadows of rabbits on th Last winter 1covered the same gr< on my own, no gun. Martha and 1VilUlU have gone to rest. Todd has tethered his horses under the hill. Mungo too, from a fall at the baling. Yet my breathing seemed to make their shapes; and Matthew\u2019s and Hugh\u2019s, and my own bringing up the rear. At the road-end 1stopped and stood for some time, just listening. My hands growingnumb. Then1crossedthetrack to where a single rabbit lay twitching, big-headed, eyes bulging, in pain. I took the heaviest stone I could find; and with one blow beat in its brains. puCh vvJ 4a 'IVuc 'teW ' in&nl3 eta ^ \n￼_______\u201e_____ stallion lay shivering in its stall. Two nights running, Todd stayed in the stable mopping the fever up, packing blankets and straw, trying a mixture of bran and mash, all other tricks failing. 6 TODD| a sequence U z I can still see him at the head of the byre: the cloth cap, the clogs tipped with steel, the stool under one arm, the red hands. Or shuffling from stall to stall, religiously humped. Feet splaying the pail, one cheek against the belly of the beast. Later on in the kitchen, over porridge and cream, his talk all of Jacob, of Moses and Aaron, of Daniel in the lions\u2019 den. The front room hung with prints of horses, paintings of himself in trap and gig. On the sideboard, the silver cups he had won. When his turn came he lay a long time ill, his skull shining, the mind fumbling to a conclusion of its own. Not complaining. Could it really be he did not notice his shadow diminishing against the wall, his skin going the colour of wasted grain? \n￼7 The beams stretched and shrank. The lamp hissed. Next morning the byremen brought ropes, and hauled. The dead weight slumped. Nothing could get it to its feet. The breath rotten, the flanks acid, its hindquarters done. The vet came, in a yellow coat. As he reached the door the stallion came shuddering upright, head forking, eyes huge and rolling, hooves flint on stone. When it had been put down, Todd undid his leggings, coughing up green rheum, asking why each time the vet came a good beast had to die! Ill The yard is littered with scrap, with axles and tyres, buckled hoops and springs - all rusting. The wreckage of cars that have been dumped. The hut is still there. In the doorway two men talk horses - but not as he did in the days when the Clydesdales came to be shod, the milk-wagons for repair. The din of iron on iron brings it all back: Rob beating the anvil, to a blue flame; the beast straining, the bit biting in, horn burning, the sour tang of iron, the sizzling, the perfect fit of the shoe. or \u2022 In his mind\u2019s eye, the whole yard is teeming with horses, ducking blackthorn, tails ^ . - swishing, the gates behind them clangin^T)->^2_\" The men have started to strip an old van. In passing he takes a kick at the wing. Nofone notices. The dead metal does not ring at all.
