SETTING. 10 on 12 Garamond x 24ems with reduced white space @ 03 throughout, ranged left text (except for 2 prose sections in Desmond Graham section - pp.55-6 - which justify right). Titles are hold, same point size. Subtitles italics same point size; section numbers roman, either ordinary or roman numerals (1 or I) as indicated at first occurrence. Page heads;*are 18pt Garamond bold caps flushed right with thin rule across whole column width, with 2mm between bottom of type^an| rule; 10mm space between rule and top of first title. Thereafter the poet's name is repeated on each page in italics 10 on 12:, separated from the page number (which is bold same peirit size) by a gap of two ems; the gap between the battoji of thase heads and ±3 the top of the text is always ^! H emifo Spacing: Between xasixn stanzas,ra space equivalent to that occupied by one line of type?c\"Tjetween poems, two or three lines of space, as indicated (sometimes 2-g-). 2. GALLEYS. \"The text has been measured so that each page does not exceed:;a depth of 42 lines 10 on 12, or 41 lines in the case of the first-'p>age of each poet. I want to avoid virtually all cutting up, so the layout is incorporated in the setting. NB: Each page occupies one sheet of typescript. Please give me three pages per gaLley, with a decent gap between these on the sheet. Pages jDHo 5 can be done on one galley, or with the brochure setting. 3« RUN-ON LINESo Because of the way the book has been measured, run-on lines are problematic. If a line breaks 24 ems, try accommodating it with reduced space 06 (that line only); if this doesn't work, run it on to the line below, with the line below indented three ems from the left (keeping reduced space at 03), and mark the typescript for me. 4. The copy is complete except for pages 10-19 and 103-4, which are prose (same setting justified). These will follow at the end of the week. Please bill the whole lot together. A lot of titles are in single inverted commas. The line spaces are very important, so please try to make them as indicated.

The right-hand grid is in effect the same as the left-hand one, but upside-down. There is a discrepancy in that the typesetting does not quite fill the column width of 103mm; it should always be pasted from the left-hand margin, so that if there is a gap of about 1mm anywhere it will always be on the right. The column width is therefore really 102mm, and the right-hand margin 16mm on a right-hand page and 21mm on a left-hand one; the left-hand margin is always 20mm (right-hand page) or 15mm (left-hand page). \n￼QtK?OI AC.
