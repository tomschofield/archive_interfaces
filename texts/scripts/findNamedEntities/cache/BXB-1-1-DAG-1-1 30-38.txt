FROM A WINDOW IN DURHAM CATHEDRAL 1 Stretches of this country smell so bad, I apologise. We laugh at your, \u2018I\u2019d think About my love for an Island that stinks.\u2019 Those hours we took to find the North had Become a straight line: imperceptible curves Broken by an occasional roundabout, Until talk ran out and we banned ourselves From idle thoughts of the distant South. Wake up love. We\u2019ve long passed the border. The South is irredeemable. The slanted light From the early summer sun is colder, Now it casts elongated shadows of you and I Ascending the stairs to our love-nest Where we smell tired and unwilling to rest. 2 We always star in one another\u2019s dreams In full technicolor and super sixteen. We fall asleep like spoons and only turn When one or the other decides to turn. Morning is a silence that won\u2019t fracture. An elbow-room closeness and the odd gesture Confirms the other\u2019s thoughts in sea-air thick With desire. We nod our approval at brick In a city w'here I first said, I love you, Climbing the cathedral\u2019s 325 steps to view One shire shouldering the next, like molars, As God would have it or Buddha, or some polar Icecap and then the warming of the globe, Exactly as the heat I feel when inside you. 30 \n￼D'Aguiar part one 27/4/93 7:47 pm Pagg^l 3 These are the people I told you about, The ones with mostly goodness in their mouths. They treat us like old friends come back at last. The pints you and I lever to nought renew fast, Faster than we can toast the water of Tyneside. Late into the evening we find seats side by side. Our legs touch and when I shift it\u2019s to feel your hip As I see it through this straight glass at my lip. I\u2019ve brought you here to be undressed by all Their kind and hungry eyes, only to take You to a Hi-Fi lit dark, Motown Soul, And enough spring water by the bed to slake The thirst of two flushed, open-mouthed lovers, Through locked-eyes, locked-arms, hip-locked hours. 4 My love you fill my head to distraction. I am pacing a room you hardly looked into, Furthest from the bedroom-cum-granary Where we lived and loved and woke in an aviary That quietened as the light intensified And objects muddled by the dark, clarified. All that night nothing could come between us, A sliver of light or dark couldn\u2019t separate us. By morning the bed had split into half - Us in a dividing current on two rafts; Us in our deep dreams, private and sweet. How did we drift apart, even in sleep? One look from you of panic, loss, love, And I leapt from my raft to share yours. r 31 \n￼. vy 5 I hold up your 501s against my waist To get the measure of you: come back, now, From that big, big city that pulled you away, To this one main street, coastal town, With five minute jams and one of most things. I knew between us, me and Whidey Bay, We couldn\u2019t make you stay. We tried everything: Flora and fauna, the sea\u2019s light displays. Your long, elegant legs opened fluently. I eased into a wet, warm, silky place That made us gasp, quicken, then rock gently- Our eyes searching one another\u2019s eyes and facfe;----- When not one of ninety nine cars registered Passing the house in the rush-hour was heard. 6 This kind of loving wrecks the body, Makes it impossible to function properly. You wake up mid-morning feeling like the night before, But to go back to bed would turn your head forever. You stay on your feet and sway like a ship Becalmed, waiting for anything to happen, to slip Your world back into orbit, but nothing does, Except the light slips and you register a dull pulse. The ship is hers and the sea is hers, the light You see the world by, hers; the loving that night Was all hers; the feeling that you\u2019re wrecked, hers. The love you think is a blessing is a curse, A weakness, something not hers, but yours: stop, / Before you have no pulse, before you drop. 32 D'Aguiar part one 18/3/93 9:29 pm Pa \n￼D'Aguiar part one 27/4/93 9:39 am Pa 7 Your touch, I\u2019d nearly forgotton your tom __ And you\u2019ve been gone less than a month, mufch- Less; yet here I am using poetry as hype To conjure you from a Daguerreotype; From a past neither of us could have known. The fine tremor in your hands is mine now, As is that chain of sweat on your upper lip. I offer my China silk hanky whose tip Sticks out of my top left hand jacket pocket And a half-smile: take it, use it to mop The sweat beaded on fur so delicate It might be kissed away, not electrocuted. All I can do is call you up and hope you\u2019ll come, And pray that in calling you, no harm\u2019s done. 8 The miles between you and I open up. The days stretch out against all my wishes. I fight betrayal when a hand brushes mine, Preferring a bruise from an upper cut Delivered by one of Whitley Bay\u2019s British Movement. A stranger\u2019s eyes make four with mine, I hot up instantly like a four bar blues Launched by Muddy Waters or B.B. King. Not so long ago we watched a moon in a shoe Step from that shoe which changed to something We couldn\u2019t name, as clouds do, then the moon Perched on a lake big like the sea; that moon Looked like it owned the lake and all around. But we watched it fall into that lake and drown. 33 \n￼D'Aguiar pare one 27/4/93 9:40 am Pa> When I turn my back on this North of Norths And I kiss you goodbye, how come it hurts? When se^it winds loosen a stinging rain On Whitley Bay, your tears drown out mine. This curved beach of seaweed and stones Shows from my wavy footprints I\u2019m all alone. The waves form an orderly queue to see Who\u2019s the miserable man bringing misery. When those waves wreck in despair on sandstone, It\u2019s my back breaking with my need for home. I give up town and sea for glass and concrete, And a capital adding to itself, House by red brick house on the For Sale shelf, And new-post-code street by tarmacked street. _- I 34 o- / e \n￼D'Aguiar part one 27/4/93 9:41 am Pa Frail Deposits (for Wilson Harris ) 1. The Trench Revisited We\u2019re being driven past when you point to Where you\u2019d pushed in a friend long, long ago, Into what was a trench, to test its depth. You say it taught you how a civilisation, Feeling a blow or tug may still not know A hand\u2019s involved, so can\u2019t feel indebted. I was falling, horizontally, just To keep up and lucky to win your trust. Push him again, he\u2019ll fall on land that\u2019s dry This time and think nothing of it, and you\u2019ll Bank all that knowledge lifted from the sight Your friend made clad in mud, convinced totally That he slipped and your hand on his ribcage Was your brave, unlucky, one-hand-clap save! 2 A Jealous God The light on our first morning at breakfast Is such that three women as many hundreds Of yards away in pleated, cotton frocks as Blinding as if the green, yellow and red Are light sources and we\u2019re in some studio Within touching distance of them; we look Their way, quiet and still, more like study Than look, they are grouped close, signing their talk. The sun is a jealous God are your words. Suddenly nothing means much anymore; Watching those three women, a timeless world Regards us as much as we regard her: We feed like enraged Ugolino fed, Though captive, on his captured jailer\u2019s head. \n￼D'Aguiar part one 27/4/93 9:41 am Pag(^~yl 3 Bone Flute \u2018This your son?\u2019 enquires the curator As we waltz in for our official tour. You finger the thousand year flute of bone As if about to burst out with a tune. You tell how the bone came from an enemy, Morsels of whose flesh is consumed by them. When air is blown into the fashioned bone, The enemy\u2019s knowhow and plans are summoned. The flute I\u2019m trying to blow a tune on Belongs to you, got by me over years from Stringing your thoughts sentence by sentence, Or what must stand for you in your absence: Having to check when I\u2019ve said something To see if it\u2019s yours since it has your ring. 4 Seawall You explain rudimentary quantum theory: The frailty of us jetting above weather From one world touching down in another With a wheel-screech equalling our surprise. Ah, to leave marks in this life that survive! That outstrip the skids of a jet\u2019s tyre! The stretch of seawall we walk looks breached. A man who seems too fit to beg wants change. The sea is muddy, loud and creased in the distance. We have to lean a little into a welcome breeze, Our heads bowed from the direct beat of sun. The soldiers in barracks reach us in waves Dictated by the wind\u2019s direction and pace; Dear God, I think, don\u2019t let this moment pass. 36 \n￼D'Aguiar part one 27/4/93 9:41 am Pa 102a 1 Rain on the slate roof and more rain collects in gutters then down drains. Where does the picture come from of it falling up? I hear a rhythm: drips, slips, taps, smatterings, rattles; out of this a pattern surfaces that is thought itself. Then the thought purely to do with rain, turns right on itself, as if against all that water washing the world, reverses water up drains to rise off the roofslates to where it\u2019s still, floats, and is weightless. 2 Cold in a room that won\u2019t be driven out by heat, hangs solid like a gas lantern or mosquito net or drapes or a web dangling preciously in a strip of light. I look at why it has settled for here. The shape of the room is no longer room-shape but the form cold takes settling in a place; and I don\u2019t belong; heat doesn\u2019t belong. I am no longer simply feeling cold, I am being asked to leave, pushed out by it into another cold, into the open where size and blue puts the cold in capitals. 37 \n￼-0- D'Aguiar pare one 27/4/93 9:41 am Pa- Early morning light weighs nothing. Lacking the conviction, it cuts through windows, but avoids corners; filling the room with live shadows. The roof over my head takes on extra layers and new pressures. I am instructed not to move, even a mere flicker could demolish this delicate balance. The main beam is not the main beam I take it for but the very weakness I see and criticise in light. I begin this apology, noiseless, urgent and scared that the roof might collapse and light fall flush on me, and I might end up crushed. 38 ","docTitle":"","docDate":"1993-03-18"},"meta":{"contentType":"text/raw","emVer":"7.1.1103.5","langIdVer":"DefaultLangId","processingVer":"CalaisJob01","submissionDate":"2014-07-01 09:50:28.426","submitterCode":"57b17a53-6e34-87b0-20ff-a419896f49c9","signature":"digestalg-1|YH1cuAoYrLttOAmqonqyd1BsiI0=|IKDwLex6c/6tZQVjaNlSaBeXAXs7wzefj+0z9MKJcHRCqFLxV7IEgA==","language":"English"}},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/e424604f-9cc2-3870-8775-05e9c5cca803/lid/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http://d.opencalais.com/lid/DefaultLangId/English"},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/b3d5d979-5f24-31e3-8da8-fcfaf3bf61d5":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"Facility","name":"FROM A WINDOW IN DURHAM CATHEDRAL","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/Facility","instances":[{"detection":"[from Whitley Bay Troubled but not distressed. ]FROM A WINDOW IN DURHAM CATHEDRAL[ 1 Stretches of this country smell so bad, I]","prefix":"from Whitley Bay Troubled but not distressed.
