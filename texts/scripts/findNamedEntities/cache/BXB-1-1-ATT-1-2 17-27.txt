On chariots of wire, we wander the high walled peaks of this consumer paradise and I marvel at the natural beauty and fertility of a Flemish valley. Suddenly the checkout lady, noticing my vacant stare, enquires if I need the toilet, curses in a guttural burp, and throws us onto the street. Mountaineering in Belgium is not as simple as it looks.

I can now reveal the planned New Revised Version... The Bible according to Rupert Murdoch In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was \u2018Gotcha!\u2019 And the Lord Rupert said let there be a Royal Family, and let enormous quantities of trivia and drivel be written about them, yea even unto the point where a mentally subnormal yak couldn\u2019t possibly find it interesting any more,-and let babies be born unto this Royal Family, and let the huge swathes of sycophantic^-nauseating sludge written about them surpass even that written about their parents, even though these babies and their parents are about as interesting as a wet afternoon on the terraces at Selhurst Park. And the Lord Rupert said let there be soap operas, and let each of these soap operas be so mind-numbingly moronic as to make a wet afternoon at Selhurst Park seem a truly uplifting experience, and let entire forests and the ecological balance of several continents be destroyed in the endless vistas of retarded outpourings about these unspeakable transmissions. And let there be enormous breasts, and endless bonking, and hours and days and weeks and months and years of chauvinistic cjjes so that the brain-dead prats who like the bonking and the soap operas and the breasts and the royal stories get the politics as well. And let any journalist who tries to stand up to the proprietor and editor in the name of truth, and intelligence, and integrity, and journalistic standards, be summarily dismissed, and cast forever into a bottomless pit of decomposing chimpanzee smegma, and let those journalists who suffer this fate rejoice at the great career move they have just made. And the Lord Rupert looked at his work, and even he saw that it was a load of crap, but this was the enterprise culture and it sold millions so it was good. And on the same basis he decided to take over the television too, and the earth itself wept, and little robins vomited, and cuddly furry animals threw themselves under trains, and the whole thing was filmed by Sky Channel for a horror nature programme, and the most awful thing of all was that this was just th(jbeginning... 23 & ricj^f \n￼Q A poem I wrote ten years ago, but which is, sadly, just as relevant today.
