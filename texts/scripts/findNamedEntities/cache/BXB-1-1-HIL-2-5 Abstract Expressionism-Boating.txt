It was snowing - the sort of weather, the harbour-master said, one minute you were wishing you were dying, the next minute you were wishing that you weren\u2019t; and the girl with the big dog laughed, although she didn\u2019t understand him, and she was only wearing a cardigan, so she must have been terribly cold. Then the harbour-master invited her into his little office, where two German tourists, looking very much at home, were painting the sea. Was it you who was saying, the bigger one said, Ad Reinhardt went all the way round the world and took 5000 photographs - or was it 50,000? - and not a single one of a human, not a single one! Her partner nodded, and gave the dog a sandwich, and then looked up at the owner, who got one too. , 115 \u2014 \n￼Hill Trembling 124-160 3/2/94 2:02 pm^Bage 138 Sips They come from certain over-heated quarries that operate illicitly, in relays, for those who are attracted to the flowers that grow gigantic in the noonday sun. And then they come on here and pester me - sort of pester, sort of guide my lips until, like them, I learn to sip the flowers that grow so big they block the daylight out, and people are condemned to live in darkness; and, such is their confusion, every day men with yellow dogs patrol the rocks and kill and quarter anything that moves. 138 e \n￼Hill Trembling 124-160 3/2/94 2:04 pm 0ge 149 - VOvejAVr TheTmjrney I met him on the stairs quite unexpectedly, and there and then I left the little hospital and, trusting him as much, or more, than humans, followed him, without a word - to you. Some of you, I know, have been expecting us, have waited years, in fact, for our arrival, so can I take this opportunity of thanking you for your encouragement? Your country, as you know, is not well liked, and anyone who comes, must come alone. We have to make our way across the mountains by intuition, some would say mistake, not really knowing why we started out, or who we are, or what we\u2019re looking for. It\u2019s like the special side-room at the hospital that patients other patients were unsettled by, patients needing quiet, used to sleep in. And people loathed it. Anything but that! Why? Because it\u2019s up a little stair, and looking out on nothing but the moors. But once they did, and this applied to everyone, a subtle transformation would come over them. \n￼Hill Trembling 124-160 3/2/94 2:03 pm 0 ge 147 W olves Normally a rather timid man, he knew exactly what he had to do - find a wolf, and, watching every movement, kneel down before her in the darkness where endless little bands of beady nightlife stream like gold across the forest floor as if there\u2019s been some terrible mistake that only they are able to correct, only they and those like them who know. Most of all, he needed to kneel down - something not encouraged in an office. Offices are not the place for tiptoeing, gazing, kneeling, anything like that. Offices are not the place for wolves, or anyone involved with them, or night. Offices are meant for office-workers. Anybody else will be removed and flattened out in basements by machines. Nothing is the name they\u2019ll be remembered by, lots of it, as ordered, nice and flat. \n￼Hill Trembling 124-160 3/2/94 2:02 pm 0ge 143 The Island Men want to understand, and think they do, and maybe if they don\u2019t it\u2019s not their fault, but basically this place belongs to us. We like to organise ourselves ourselves. And anyway, anyone can visit - brothers, fathers, lovers, anyone. My son comes often; or I visit him. You ask us if we miss them. Not at all. We don\u2019t use cars, or electricity, and men especially seem to find that hard. Another thing - we feel healthier. We work the horses; bear much fewer children; and eat and dress and live very simply. We shepherd sheep. We scale trees for fruit. We abseil cliffs for samphire and fresh eggs; and some of us, as you have pointed out, migrating to the cities, abseil glass. \n￼Hill Trembling 95-123 3/2/94 12:33 pm ge 121 & HtstAwwvi _JEke-Marble Quarry (for Heywood and fenny) Only the movement of the occasional rabbit or the drifting shadow of a distant crow f disturbed the stillness of the marble quarrry, and it must have been nearly an hour, >'he told me later, before$he noticed there was someone there - white as fish-bones, white as sun-bleached eye-lashes, white as the elongated mother-of-pearl lozenges cunningly inlaid in the musical cigarette-box of her second home, white as the hands of the man who delivers her anthracite beans. \n￼Trembling 95-123 3/2/94 12:29 pm/Page 106 What Happens in the Present Why do they have to have their fried eggs and black coffee and tame maids and an urgent phone-call to make, and not enough time to time time? And are their holidays really relaxed enough? And are the shops near enough? And the car servile enough? And is the moment following the moment following the moment fast enough? so they never get touched by the present\u2019s immediate present - where women walk to beaches with white skin; where the beach-chalets\u2019 very decay lends them an air of sanctity we feel at home in; where salt smells of salt; where silk feels like topspin; where people we pass belong to the same side as we do, where everyone does; where a briefcase sits alone in a locked office as its owner comes crawling along a narrow ledge five storeys up to get it back, and carry it home through the streets to his strip-lit bed where bagfuls of kittens mew from nightbound skips; where someone like me - for the sake of the way things are, for the sake of the present, for the sake of its calm, enigmatic compassion - will die for someone like you. \n￼Hill Trembling 124-160 3/2/94 2:02 prrw-Page 140 How To Be Happy In the crowded hold of someone\u2019s boat, chocolate sauce is being poured on pears that shudder as the chocolate coats their shoulders and spreads its lip across each tilted plate, across the laps of guests, the rubber floor, till everything is sunk in utter darkness, and no one speaks, and no one even moves. Years go by; then someone\u2019s eyes make out the polished surface of a chocolate sea where tiny golden boats are busy fishing. 140 \n￼Hill Trembling 124-160 3/2/94 2:04 pm ge 150 Boating Few, if any, went to bed that night, and in the morning rescue teams set out. Only those too weak to help remained - the little man, the children, three small hens. They waited in the house for what seemed days until a river made of melting snow carried them away towards the sea - everyone, that is, except the man, who had a boat, and rowed upstairs to bed, but even that, his fifty-year-old bed; slipped away as he approached, like sand, and the house itself was washed away, and he was left to roam the world alone, rowing through the treetops in his nightshirt, or sometimes rowing, sometimes simply drifting, feeling too relaxed to really think; but once he saws,or-thetigh-t-he--saw^.a woman* waving from the rail of a liner; but when he called, she didn\u2019t answer him - as if to stop him calling out like that and spoiling the whole joy of the occasion. ivTxiAC. 150 -e- ","docTitle":"","docDate":"1994-03-02"},"meta":{"contentType":"text/raw","emVer":"7.1.1103.5","langIdVer":"DefaultLangId","processingVer":"CalaisJob01","submissionDate":"2014-07-01 09:53:40.179","submitterCode":"57b17a53-6e34-87b0-20ff-a419896f49c9","signature":"digestalg-1|DvrW1ddIQVk7dXiVwXx+fieHTso=|RYOdzqxKONobhhbNFetVOrkaqrwomGc7Saz9KZeEePDFDXxV5iJnRA==","language":"English"}},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/e0f64fb9-c65d-374b-b369-9a7d90c968a2/lid/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http://d.opencalais.com/lid/DefaultLangId/English"},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/3386c302-733d-3892-ac3b-9ecd63d2977c":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"IndustryTerm","name":"rubber floor","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/IndustryTerm","instances":[{"detection":"[tilted plate, across the laps of guests, the ]rubber floor[, till everything is sunk in utter darkness, and]","prefix":"tilted plate, across the laps of guests, the ","exact":"rubber floor","suffix":", till everything is sunk in utter darkness, and","offset":6232,"length":12}],"relevance":0.202},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/57ce9ddc-df4a-3a03-ad6b-ce810f7ad612":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"IndustryTerm","name":"electricity","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/IndustryTerm","instances":[{"detection":"[we miss them.
