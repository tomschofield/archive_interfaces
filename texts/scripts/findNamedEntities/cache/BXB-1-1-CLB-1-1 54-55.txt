They can remember all my antics on the pitch better than I can. \u2018Arthur, you\u2019re a fuckin onion\u2019 I shouted because he was useless & that time I took my shirt off & handed it to the psycho full-back saying \u2018here, have it\u2019, when he fouled me & the day there was a minute\u2019s silence for some league official so the Ref blew his whistle & the Prof went steamin down the wing shouting for the ball, he had to walk back feeling a right ejit & we cracked up & there was that game on a cow field at the back of Carnlough, Fat screaming at the specky Ref who didn\u2019t book him, no way, didn\u2019t send him off either, just ripped out the corner flag, ran at him & threatened to \u2018carry his fuckin head off!\u2019 & I had to be called Brian when we played away fixtures, at least in some places, say in Ballyclare where the Dirts in their bomber jackets waved Red Hands & Union Jacks behind the goalposts weren\u2019t anything abnormal & fights were many & games got abandoned & once the old Whitehead team had to leap in their cars, escape with their kit still on. Brian has stuck with me since. I\u2019ve always needed an alias & all this floods back to me as I dander about, & steamin someone like D.J. rolls over, grips my arm & asks me: \u2018Boutya Brian, how long are ye home for?\u2019 & I think \u2018more like how long before I get away!\u2019... 54 *T .iV \n￼Cleary 53-80 13/7/93 7:02 pm Page 55 Wedding in Omagh \u2018Am I an alien or what?\u2019 I wondered at that July wedding somewhere near Omagh. The night before a wake was happening too so a steady stream of punters came to the parlour & Maggie\u2019s aunt wore a man\u2019s coat, smoked Old Holborn & boiled her uncle\u2019s eggs in a rusty old peach tin. No kidding! when she got the ham sandwiches out they came from a drawer in the sideboard, ' no plates & all of this watchd over by the bride\u2019s mother, she\u2019d become a vegetable through giving birth & you couldn\u2019t tell as she rocked in her chair making wailing sounds, if she disapproved of anything or everything was turning out as she hoped. & I knew how far I\u2019d wandered when revellers teased Thomas, the bridegroom, rolling their eyes, nudging him about the honeymoon & I honestly got the feeling they\u2019d not fucked yet & all that innocence puts a strain on me & at the wedding the priest picked out members of the crowd, taunting \u2018Take stock of this, Mick, it could be your turn- next\u2019 or \u2018Pat, I see you\u2019ve the best suit on for therladies\u2019. S fan] 55 After the reception, muddled about my future, & whiskey lapping round my stomach, I caught the Belfast bus then the next day the ferry to Stranraer\u2019s ugliness. In my head I could hear my mother speaking: \u2018Aye, son, you\u2019ll learn, far away fields are green\u2019...
