Now football is a funny game, as the uterly retarded cliche goes, and on this particular evening it proved to be a very funny game indeed, in fact a positively hilarious and side-splittingly humourous one, even more mirth- inducing than Princess Diana trying to define existentialism or William Waldegrave having sex with a paper-shredding machine. For while Palace's much-feared rivals Brighton & Hove Albion were slaughtering Wolverhampton Wanderers 4-2, at Anfield the final score was Liverpool 9, Crystal Palace 0. Liverpool 9, Crystal Palace nil. N-n-n-nine nil, nine nil. N-n-n-nine nil, nine nil. And following those fateful n-n-n- ninety minutes on that hilarious Tuesday night the hapless halibuts from Selhurst Park were subjected to fierce and merciless ridicule from the rest of the football world and many of them are still living out their experiences to this day. Even now the South London branch of the Samaritans are receiving streams of mysterious phone calls where the only audible sounds are donkey-like voices braying bewilderedly 'Nine- nil. N-n-n-nine nil. Ee-aw! Nine nil. N-n-n-nine nil. Ee-aw!' And when the Palace players got home, obviously in need of moral support and counselling following their torrid n-n-n-nine nil experience, none of them received a hero's welcome. None of them. None of them received a hero's welcome. N-n-n-none of them. The long-term effects of such an unbelievable n-n-n-nine nil stonking are hard to predict, but it seems likely that many of the Crystal Palace squad may be so demoralised that they may be forced to leave professional football and sign on.
