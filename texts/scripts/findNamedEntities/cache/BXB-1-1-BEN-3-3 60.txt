She is twelve years old but growing younger every day away from home. Letters from her mother are pale and creased with wear: (Be very good and when we get some petrol we\u2019ll come and see you. Tigger sends his love.) M r Rainey, the lodger, gives her a yellow smile over the breakfast toast, while the others rush off to their war-work. Plump-fingered, silver-haired, with something dark staining his waistcoat, he divides his butter ration into seven greasy morsels. One morning she wakes to panic - a pool of blood on the sheets, a fierce, gripping ache, a hot wave of fear and shame. She shuts herself in until Mrs J. comes home and reassures her. It's just growing up dear. Mysterious accessories, elaborate with elastic. The sheets taken away with a tired sigh. The bathroom is down a dim, narrow passage, a place of awkward passings and pleasantries. Coming outgone day carrying something shaming ana private behind her back, she comes face to face with Mr Rainey, who puts a doughy hand on her shoulder. I know what you\u2019d like my dear. Ginger biscuits. You must come and have tea in my room. She runs to the kitchen stove, that temperamental comforter and incinerator. She knows she must accept: that is what is meant by being good. So at four o\u2019clock he leans over her with his plate of biscuits. His sardine breath shuts off the air. 60 y Back & Front 9-64 20/4/90 4:30 pm Pag^ ","docTitle":"","docDate":"1990-04-20"},"meta":{"contentType":"text/raw","emVer":"7.1.1103.5","langIdVer":"DefaultLangId","processingVer":"CalaisJob01","submissionDate":"2014-07-01 09:46:16.852","submitterCode":"57b17a53-6e34-87b0-20ff-a419896f49c9","signature":"digestalg-1|oQvPFTFw7Lm1YWV19A0OY7BuGvc=|Nt7j/du1JZYK8ecP2BhwvbkM71qJRFzH9+lx62hkHF8gTf4D5MOYAA==","language":"English"}},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/da94d012-f120-3c09-a7b9-914c7f48bb04/cat/1":{"_typeGroup":"topics","category":"http://d.opencalais.com/cat/Calais/Hospitality_Recreation","classifierName":"Calais","categoryName":"Hospitality_Recreation","score":0.862},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/da94d012-f120-3c09-a7b9-914c7f48bb04/lid/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http://d.opencalais.com/lid/DefaultLangId/English"},"http://d.opencalais.com/pershash-1/072acc58-53a2-3499-8d2b-4093b12bc3f9":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"Person","name":"Rainey","persontype":"N/A","nationality":"N/A","commonname":"Rainey","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/Person","instances":[{"detection":"[behind her back, she comes face to face with ]Mr Rainey[, who puts a doughy hand on her shoulder.
