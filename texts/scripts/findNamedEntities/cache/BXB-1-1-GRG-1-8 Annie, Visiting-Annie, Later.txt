I sat in the chair and stroked the cat. I sat on the cat and examined the shoes: you'd broken a lace and re-tied it - We've all tried that and it seldom fails to fail, and love like your cat is tough and wails when sat on or scared - This foolishness won't recur. When you get home, I'll have gone running miles from here; catch me if you're fit, if I tire, if we dare. t \n￼AH5IE, 15 SPRIIG I'll say this much and once only: life is not a dream. The dreamers who say so never loved you; they were misinformed who never laid a finger on your skin. As you wake in Spring the fuzz on the pussy willow and the willow itself are one. There is nothing out of focus here. The sun on our shoulders blooms, passes, but what more would we ask of light? What is seen, is; the eyes have it. Now the sheen on the chestnut and the chestnut itself embrace in her hair - there is no further waking. \n￼AFFIE, IF THE MDRFIFG £0, The white cat at the window knows being ever composed around itself. Two mechanics lean over my car; today's composed around what goes and what does not - New points, son, condenser's gone. The philosophical one borrows a smoke, pokes the engine, speaks of Maya, the Veil of Illusion. Stuff and nonsense! This no-start's stuff enough - No problem, a tenner - that's the nonsense. Make it five? Money's real too, there should be more poems about money. Six and it's done. The world's not counterfeit. You're on. Anoit , in Hht ?A rnee..') So get cracking, hand me back my life-enhancing cigarette! That Veil: rend it as you will, nothing's hung behind - yet isn't she beautiful, tranced in the doorway? In her breathed warm breath there is no other. Of course I'm scared - to love and risk that word, when today's going up in smoke! Go, roll one of your own. My car shakes, our hearts take leaps and bounds - we're going on a spin somewhere the white cat at the window knows. / \n￼ASFIE, LATER Enough fourteen-bar compressed & gurgling pibrochs to you, Annie, whoever you were before (I mythed you). There are affairs more pressing than lave, say they who have it. In my town the bookie's gone up-market, we've opened a deli, cut library hours but still my neighbour's roof leaks into mine. Would we were seperate, or one ... The Chancellor parks his belly on TV, praises the economy, burps; Auld Scotia is a bag of wind in History's oxter, endlessly lamenting. Time to leave, leave off or Rush hour. The trucks point forth and whine, the low sun splits the Road Bridge like a reed. - Stay to squeeze out notes, wilder than before.
