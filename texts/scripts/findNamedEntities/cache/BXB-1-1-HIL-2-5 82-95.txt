The bluebells shine with Daddy\u2019s violet light. She even brought her mole with her. Don\u2019t cry. She ran about the rocks till it was night. Toast and cream. Her deep-blue velvet dresses. I haven\u2019t told the others where I\u2019ve been. Dragonflies fly round her head in traces. There may be someone there - we\u2019ll have to see. Someone to talk to, cold as charity. An analgesic and a febrifuge. Lop-eared sheep in echoing ravines. The tiny nun is venturing to intrude. Lamented daughters slip away like cats; running water; seals; grace abounding: a crippled Coptic mother\u2019s early sorrows, through centuries of beaten earth resounding. The doctors say my shyness is repellent. The shyness of the bittern. I\u2019m alone, living in a world where pinks and pumas drink cherry-flavoured drops of Methadone. The other people cut down all the trees and vivisect the cats and toads. Roulette. Making honey sandwiches. Misgivings. The way my mother handles ducks. Nanette. Even the Central Predigstuhl\u2019s West Gully denied us shelter in its icy palace. Irish monks in frail craft made of leather discovered Iceland, glaciers and solace. 82 -e- \n￼TEhCir YovRSecp ■e The golden dribbles of the butterscotch tremble on the rubber. She can\u2019t swim. She\u2019s singing like a lover through the water, singing through the glass her blue-green hymn. Crystal quartz like love from Colorado. Sealed with rheum. The chickens\u2019 sunlit meal scattered on the lily-pond. \u2018Raw, tender, hostile, hot or bored - how do you feelT I feel like a table-cloth with grazing rights; a newt; a guinea-fowl; a tulip-head; the listlessness of rivers\u2019 eels; bandages. Don\u2019t tell me what you think I should have said! My body\u2019s like a zebra\u2019s; rock-hard plums; the glittering of quartz washed by the sea; Dorothy Wordsworth\u2019s toothache, like a crystal; amber tea. Measuring my sleeping lover\u2019s neck. Chicken thighs. A greeting. Take your time. Running water soothes; a little music. I can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s like. Like mine. His hand is lying on my lap like liver. Wiping up the blood. He\u2019s very kind. Every little star must twinkle brighter. The poor thing\u2019s got no breasts. 0 never mind. Bunches of butchered seagulls. Dusky archers. You must be someone special. Hold my hand. Bit by bit, not suddenly. Peach. Barley. I thought you were never coming. Hold my hand. The handsome sleeping generals lie massacred like beautiful white flour from Singapore. -0- Hill Trembling 59-94 3/2/94 1:47 pm Rage 83 83 \n￼Hill Trembling 59-94 3/2/94 1:47 pm Raje 84 Who but a beaten specialist would offer to map the changes of the ocean floor? I didn\u2019t say a word about the therapy. The doctors deal in glitter-coated worms. A schizophrenic dressed in silk to please him, I part my lips like lilac, brush his sperm. I said I was afraid of him, and everyone. My mother was a copper kangaroo. Liquorice and shrimps inside her locker. I go to pieces in the afternoon. I think the nurse said she was going to shoot me. I can\u2019t sit up. I don\u2019t know what to say. The bead-like packing may be tiny pearls. Hush, everyone loves fear. Don\u2019t go away. The shaved and beaded Maasai mothers calmly wash their sons in milk from special cows. He said that if I walk along serenely, I\u2019m worthy of their gold and violet flowers. They broke into my room, and I was murdered - innocent, illuminated, rose. I cannot touch my cup in case they see me. My mother leaves my laundry with the nurse. She turns the light out, leaving me in darkness, a dumb, adored, impassive amulet: ah, I will be so lovely in the summertime, when Doctor parts my sleepy body\u2019s net. The central point round which the volumes settle, his doll is staring like the smell of gas. He wants to be alone with me. I\u2019m sweating. My body will dissolve. \u201cCan\u2019t you relax?\u201d 84 -0\" \n￼Hill Trembling 59-94 3/2/94 1:47 pm Raje 85 A dressmaker of hollyhocks and butter, lying headless on my sunlit porch, waiting by the door to see the doctor - hear me play my isolated chords! Sunny days of quiet desperation. \u201cShe misses her poor daughter still, you know!\u201d Sunlight. Netball. Ankle-socks. White rabbits. Ceaseless prayer like purity of snow. Rescued from her introverted nightmare by seeing washing billowing on the line. Doing certain things. \u201cYes, please sit anywhere!\u201d We sit on any surface we can find. \u2018Write a list of gratifying activities.\u2019 Tomato juice makes glasses hard to clean. Suddenly the man leans down and bites me. The lily-pond - the carp - the bluebells\u2019 gleam. The gods of Europe shower me with smiles, unnerving all the men that come and stare; I dance until my heart begins to break - then Sister comes and makes me brush my hair. The dog has got a little curly tail the size and texture of a tangerine. The bluebells are as glossy as the horses, galloping like lust into the sea. The penned imported camels by the villa, like ghostly castles made of sand and bone, lean their narrow hips against the darkness, waiting for a love they\u2019ve never known. w- \n￼Hill Trembling 59-94 3/2/94 1:48 pm 33-86 CHAPTER 3 Monks I am alone. Where are they? Snowy weather. Am I allowed to write like this or not? She said that I could go to the meeting, and then she said that I had better not. The girl in my room is reading ALONE WITH OTHERS. I really feel I can\u2019t go through with this. \u2018Walking through a forest with a parcel.\u2019 And all she wants is my companionship. Chicory, cashew nuts, paper zebras. \u201cWhy do you look so worried?\u201d I don\u2019t know. The voices fade. The floor is piled with cushions. I wonder, will she speak when we\u2019re alone? We are the children of This. This is the silence. I haven\u2019t talked to anyone for (Jaysr I can hear a pony\u2019s rhythmic cropping. I can feel the wind against myJace. \u201cIt\u2019s been a lovely friendly convalescence, and I shall go home feeling much much better...\u201d It\u2019s miles getting back...but we don\u2019t care... miles and miles... it really doesn\u2019t matter. Larches in the forest bring the evening. Disabled men drink milk among fat hens. A sense of loss like violins pursues me and will not let me sleep, the young man says. Piano Pieces, fruit, embroidered slippers. Struggle for what? Eurhythmy. Green and neat, scentless mayweed, dragonflies, tall grasses ripple in the grounds like greyhounds\u2019 feet. The man who dances like the sea surrounds me. I\u2019m shivering. I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s so new. The Spiritual Head of the Order\u2019s started laughing. Piles of strawberry jam. \u201cMay I laugh too?\u201d 86 \n￼Hill Trembling 59-94 3/2/94 1:48 pm Rz 87 As blossom fills the lawns of scented gardens, fluttering whispers fill the patient\u2019s throat. Love is more than simple acts of kindness: it comes from deep within us like a note. They play the flute until it\u2019s nearly morning. The man who heals with sound is by my side. My meditation\u2019s swilled with icy water for Ahto and Vellamo, Ahto\u2019s bride. Horses pass unseen in the forest, a speckled bantam suddenly takes flight; Molly, who is over eighty, \u2019s mending the wooden boat she painted gold last night. \u201cWhat does he mean by meditation anyway?\u201d She looks so lonely with her little plaits. Secret letters. Failing to adore him. Invisible vanilla. Roses. Cats. The dogs are neither elegant nor handsome, but make us feel warm when we are cold. The sleeping monks are sailing into morning; soya milk like cowries; silence; gold. Tinned faces. Yellow cushions. Love him more. And let your body say what you can\u2019t say. It\u2019s just a little shower, sjle said, her suffering. It\u2019s nice to know you like me. \u201cIt\u2019s OK\u201d The stone floor cools the dogs and the chicory, the memories of H., demented, dim; the heat-wave is receding from the flowers piled in her basket like the wind. She said that I could join the group tomorrow, her tilted pools of everlasting wealth! Someone in my dream is always smiling. \u2018You think it must be God but it\u2019s yourself.\u2019 e C'- 87 k clost, \n￼Hill Trembling 59-94 3/2/94 1:48 pm P. Community of nuns in Andalusia. Colossal love like thunder. Bowls of shells. The dancer had a giant dog called Hilda who used to like to eat the daffodils. The patient from the villa came to visit. Rabbit fur, damp leaves. She didn\u2019t stay. The Sister has retired to the country - irises and blackbirds, flowering may. Like mottled soap of olive-oil and soda; Nivea; flat stones, their edges gone; the soles of people paddling in the tide-line, I feel I am being acted on. Gardening gloves touch pale blue hydrangeas; \u2018becoming aware of myself as something known\u2019; my dog has gone to sleep across my pillow; ''keep the mind in the middle o f the tongue.\u2019 The hooded men who follow me and whisper have slipped away like weasels in the snow. I too must say good-bye to the monastery. The train is waiting. \u201cReally, I must go!\u201d 88 -0- \n￼Hill Trembling 59-94 3/2/94 1:49 pm Rage 89 6\" PART THREE The Last Week 4% \n￼Hill Trembling 59-94 3/2/94 1:49 pm 90 CVL/p<. Friday And all the time, the heifers\u2019 solemn faces are breathing by my side, as soft as ash; my little fire is burning in the moonlight that slips between the grasses like a cat. Saturday The painted bows. The silver nail-scissors. Strips of paper in a stencilled tin. A flannel in a bowl. Hush. What\u2019s the matter? Early morning sunlight, paper-thin. My breath is like the long electric hair of someone swinging on a high trapeze: it sweeps the air and all the faces cry ha\\ and again ha! What turnsyou on? Sunday The river-bank is thick with summer flowers, as stiff as pigs, as pink as fruit; massed flies stroke their wings against the fluted sky whose height, as sweet as hay, rings like an axe and dyes the spotted cows a million blues. 90 \n￼Hill Trembling 59-94 3/2/94 1:49 pm Raje 91 Monday At midnight we have rolls and oranges. My hands are cold. They make me cups of tea. Sons and daughters, singing in the moonlight, are drifting on their tin beds out to sea. Ankle-bones, peach-slices, mignonette; bars of chocolate, fur: I won'tforget. Tuesday I\u2019m sitting on my blanket eating toast. In India I starved. I\u2019m very fat. Mother Teresa, Mother Teresa calling. She wants me now. She wants me in her flat. A stream of sons in striped pyjamas lies listening to the chanting rise like bees C■vf from buzzing hives to heaven\u2019s lighted windows, as morning breaks, and cows approach the yard. \n￼Hill Trembling 59-94 3/2/94 1:49 pm P/33e 92 e- Wednesday A lame man walks for miles along a beach; the dazzling sunlight magnifies his dreams: a pool of blood that soaks into the pine-woods, a bungalow, dead rabbits, skin-tight jeans. Thursday The afternoon is giving way to evening, I help my tearful daughter rinse her hair; a bullfinch in the holm oak calmly singing; my holiday; Nijinsky; ginger air. From grassy hills and dark pink trees come hopping frogs and crickets into beams of light. The air beside my bed\u2019s a ballerina dancing in the arches of the night. My sleeping-bag smells sweetly of the pine-wood, my smoky hair and pillows of warm stones. The terns fly off like splinters of the evening. I\u2019m glad there\u2019s no one here. Peach-slices. Bones. \n￼-e- a Hill Trembling 59-94 3/2/94 1:49 p m R a j e 93 ^ Friday My sister has been racing someone\u2019s race-horse across a valley in the pouring rain, trying to forgive our blood-stained mother who killed her German Shepherd, Violet. The Minuetfor Bernice is playing; everything seems normal, but it\u2019s not: we look as if we\u2019re drawing, but we\u2019re praying; our studio of birds, our brotherhood. Instant mashed potato, lettuce, Spam. The rabbit on the plate is going shopping. The islands of potato warm the lettuce and stir the little virgin jockey\u2019s heart. The Boyle Family. Walsingham. Hot water. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t left her drawing-board all day.\u201d The warm dog and the Little Tern run quietly to Everlasting Light on polished-toes. Saturday Your voice is clear as crystal, so is mine; as turquoise, divers, steel, turpentine. Your fingers smell of Nivea, it\u2019s cold, your fingers smell of pine-woods and the sky; you touch my hands, you wash my eyes in water enclosed in heated towels.

The creamy tears are found in natural fissures, or trickling from the wounds of broken boughs.\u2019 The boats are on the grass, the sun is shining, the station-master tends his flower-bed.
