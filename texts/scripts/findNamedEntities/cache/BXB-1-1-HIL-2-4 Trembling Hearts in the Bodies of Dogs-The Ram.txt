He crosses the celestial ocean as helmsman of the world, called Aah, the vizier of Ra, the sun. He loads the gleaming boat with palm leaves which record the days and nights in notches, for he is the measurer of time, and he invented writing. He carries an ivory writing palette in his long black fingers, to instruct the scribes who squat before him on the sand. And he helps them on their later journey through the Night Of A Million Years as Thoth, the protector of the dead: he takes them kindly by the hand and guides them through the underworld; his nine baboon musicians fine the long bank where the travellers pass on their way to Osiris, dreaming of playing draughts \n￼with the gods and dancing with them in the Field Of Reeds. Mr Bonnet, did you meet him, and will I, when I step on board the silver barque? Will he be saying Pleased to meet you, Mrs Hill, and how\u2019s the writing going} as we descend the corridors of night into the Judgment Hall. Will he pat me on the shoulder with his cracked avuncular hand and, tucking my book inside his sky-blue cape, will he wink before he picks his tail up and climbs onto his special perch above the scales? \n￼Below Hekla I appear like a bird from nowhere. I have a new name. I am as dean as a whistle. I beat the buttermilk in big white bowls until it is smooth. I wash the pearly plates under the tap, and fifty canvas bumpers and fifty socks. They drip in the sun below grey mountains like the moon\u2019s. Each night I lift the children in their sleep and hold out the china pot for them: Wilt jpu pissa, elskan, pissa, pissa I whisper as I tiptoe from bed to bed . . . Around mid-night, I go to the geyser below Hekla and bathe in the warm water. I am a short fat English girl. I am twenty-five mothers. I lead my children in a line across the heather to the church. The father watches me from his dark door. He shakes his head, and takes me by the hand: Blessa ini, elskan, blessa pii! And now, September, dust is flying: the bus is here. I am ready. I am on my way to Reykjavik, \n￼Leith, Liverpool. . . The children of the are running to the Good-bye, give our love to 12 t \n￼The Fowlers of the Marshes Three thousand years ago they were fowling in the marshes around Thebes \u2014men in knotted skirts and tiered faience collars, who avoided the brown crocodile, and loved the ibis, which they stalked with long striped cats on strings, under the eye of Nut, the goddess of the sky. My mother\u2019s hushed peculiar world\u2019s the same: she haunts it like the fowlers of the marshes, tiptoeing gaily into history, sustained by gods as strange to me as Lady Nut, and Anubis, the oracular, the jackal-masked. When I meet her at the station, I say Hello, Mum! and think Hello, Thoth, This is the Weighing ofthe Heart. \n￼Dewpond and Black Drain-pipes In order to distract me, my mother sent me on an Archaeology Week. We lived in tents on the downs, and walked over to the site every morning. It was an old dewpond. There was a boy there called Charlie. He was the first boy I had really met. Iwas too shy to go to the pub, but I hung around the camp every night waiting for him to come back. He took no notice of me at first, but one night the two of us were on Washing-Up together. I was dressed in a black jersey and black drain-pipes, I remember. You in mourning? he said. He didn\u2019t know I was one of the first beatniks. He put a drying-up cloth over my head and kissed me through the linen Breeds Of Dogs. I love you, Charlie I said. Later, my mother blamed herself for what had happened. The Romans didn\u2019t even interest her, she said. \n￼Elegy for the Bee-god Stingless bees were bred in tree hollows for beeswax and honey. Every year, in the month called Tzec, the bee-keepers played their raspadores and danced across the fields with bells and ribbons round their feet, to honour the fat bee-god, who buzzed in the heated air to their music. He lived in a gold house in the hotlands, and drank cocoa sweetened with honey. All\u2019s quiet now, it\u2019s June, and he\u2019s not here, the late, the long-forgotten bee-god, who sped on zig-zag wings across the sky to the faithful. Cross-eyed, bejewelled and tattooed, drumming his fluffy yellow feet on the tree hollows, he gave the bees new hope, and cocoa sweetened with honey. If ever I find him \u2014thin, justly offended, dead in the dry chaparral - I will put jade beads and honey on his tongue, and wrap him in a shroud \n￼of wings, and loop his neck with pearls from Guatemala; I will light him candles of beeswax, bringing sleep, and he will rest in the shade of the First Tree, and wait for me there - humming a tune, and drinking cocoa sweetened with honey. \n￼The Ram He jangles his keys in the rain and I follow like a lamb. His house is as smoky as a dive. We go straight downstairs to his room. I lie on his bed and watch him undress. His orange baseball jacket, all the way from Ontario, dropstothefloor\u2014the ram s,infelt, arched across the hunky back. He unzips his calf-length Star-walkers, his damp black Levi\u2019s, and adjusts his loaded modelling-pouch: he stands before me in his socks \u2014 as white as bridesmaids, little daisies, driven snow. John <5J{^ain)watches from the wall beside a shelf-ful of pistols. Well, he says, d \u2019you like itf All I can think of is Granny, how she used to shake her head, when I stood by her bed on Sundays, f so proud in my soap-smelling special frock, and say Ah, Bless your little cotton socks!
