Incarcerated for most of his childhood and adolescence he appeared in Nuremberg at Whitsuntide 1828, able to write his name and say, without understanding it, one sentence: I want to be a rider like myfather was. The city fathers put him into the charge of a retired schoolteacher called Georg Friedrich Daumer, and it was in Daumer\u2019s house, in October 1829, that an unknown assail  ant struck him across the forehead with a heavy razor. Daumer, an invalid, soon afterwards asked to be relieved of the responsibility of looking after him, and Caspar moved in with Clara and Johann Christian Biberbach - but only for a few months. Clara conceived a passion for him, which he did not reciprocate, and he was moved into the safer keeping of Gottlieb von Tucher, still in Nuremberg. Then the eccentric Lord Stanhope appeared on the scene and made Caspar his ward, removing him to the town of Ansbach in Decem  ber 1831 and lodging him with another schoolmaster, one less hum  ane than Daumer, a man by the name of Johann Georg Meyer. Stanhope himself, having shown great fondness for the boy, went travelling, and after January 1832 never saw him again. Caspar was 0 murdered just before Christmas 1833. He went to meet a stranger at a monument in the the public park in Ansbach. He seems to have hoped that at this meeting the truth about^aChis life would be revealed. But the stranger stabbed him. Why he was confined, let out, assaulted, murdered, has never been quite explained. Prob  ably, as the jurist Anselm von Feuerbach believed, he had a claim to the throne of Baden; but because of his innocence and the extra  ordinary reactions of his untried nervous system to a life in the daylight people at once invested more than a dynastic, political, worldly interest in him. He was an enigma, and excited all kinds of hopes and longings. In German there is a vast literature on Caspar Hauser. I have read a good deal of it, but experts will soon see that I have taken many liberties in the pursuit of my own conception of the subject. In six of the nine cantos I imagine Daumer, Clara Biberbach and Lord Stanhope, each near death, reflecting on their dealings with Caspar.
