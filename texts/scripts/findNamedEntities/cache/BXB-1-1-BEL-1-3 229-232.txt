Are the thwarted archetypes stirring Out of their fairy dark forest? Very little clue As you twist and toss Operatically asleep And make a further spreading Over the bedclothes, operatic, Of a mane of dark hair. 'Behind 3opv$ Behind despair is forlorn hope. Inside the sinking heart It cherishes a place to mope Though ordered to depart. \n￼A Bad Day in the Bedsitter (to the shade o f Thomas Hood) Where to find the poem for a bloody day like this? Cup after strong cup of tea and then upstairs to piss, Too damned idle otherwise to drag myself from my seat, With far too many books and not quite enough to eat. Nightmare had nudged into waking its nagging disquiet And kept my nerves shaking with panicky rumours of riot. The postman went by the house without leaving a letter. It took a good few cigarettes to make me feel better. Odd passages of verse and prose consumed but no pattern Emerging to any purpose. I sat and sat on With no inspiration, listening in vain for the doorbell. Boredom turned my friendly room into a quiet comer of hell. Then my blank poise is shattered by afternoon noise When the school pours into the street all the horrible small girls and boys, And the clatter and banging and screeching are starting the dogs off- I\u2019ll go mad, run out howling, and ripping my togs off. Remembrance of things past is sad in my situation - Where are my girl friends and old friends and witty conversation? Not enough P for a pint, which makes things a bit worse, Ju st enough energy left to jangle a few lines o f verse. May this next night bring dreams according to the good Doctor\u2019s prescription, Prospective not reductive to the imagination. I\u2019ll get up early and calm and wash out a few pairs o f socks, And some kind ofletter, not O .H .M .S., will come through the box. \n￼A Vocation Possibly This tiny room, this cabin, this monk\u2019s cell Pantaloon decrepit scholar\u2019s den Shuffles me like a full pack of cards (One has to be firm and extricate the Jokers) Although there\u2019s hardly any room Between tall Wardrobe, piles of Bookcase Great Raft of Bed in the middle, almost unmade Narrow corridors to squeeze sideways Past Chair, Armchair, Wardrobe, Table, Sink The books refuse decorum on their shelves But leap into heaps on to table, chest of drawers, bed Or sprawl face downwards open on the floor Among footprinted newspapers, crosswords half filled in Then on the shelf between clock, cotton-reels, postcards, The villanous small transistor wafts me A ridge of high-low pressure, round and round and round (For five whole weeks I was mad Robert Schumann Until I said Thank God, Thank God for Ludwig Van) The typewriter gnashes angry silent teeth I almost forgot dead matches, crumbs on the rug It\u2019s safest in the armchair in front of the electric fire Regarding the Mandala and then the Sacred Cat Reading or better writing without falling asleep (I\u2019m afraid to sleep at the moment for dreams are refusing to c I almost forgot the coiling, creased and soiling clothes Wreathing into a
