The sky began as a blue bowl scooped And rimmed by the eye\u2019s orbit. Lilac was there, Still and circumscribed as in lalique, To fill a bowl\u2019s ache. The mind would hold things in little, Like itself, to grasp a lifetime\u2019s Breath, a place in emptiness. This is no blindness, But still the smaller part of seeing. Worlds spill slowly outward from their centre, The eye\u2019s bowl fills and overflows And even air must move. Wind blows. Blue on Persian blue, nflak, A sea where crests of lilac break To foam; and in their leaves, the soft Lallation of the waves. 20 e / \n￼Garrett 29/7/91 10:03 am Page 21 Tyranny of the Spectrum What shall we make O f our days, when colour, Or memory, lack All integrity, beckoning All ways to some thing Just out of the picture? Painting by numbers, The mind selects Not what the soul\u2019s Compound eye reflects, But only the coloured pencils The heart allows. A child\u2019s calendar: What could be simpler Or less refutable Than the seven bright Weathers of the week - Or more immutable? Let\u2019s say: It was so. Doubt not the snow\u2019s Whiteness, the window\u2019s Bland transparencies Nor the seven certainties O f the rainbow. Call it a grey day: In a thousand lit rooms, Children, furious With the snickersnack O f scissors, shatter rainbows, Make snow paradisiac. 21 \n￼Wedding Breakfast A table in the sunlight; Two cups of black coffee Against the cloth\u2019s impossible white, And a basket piled with cherries. How constancy dazzles with its white Lies! The shadows dark as coffee, Two cups of tricked light, A new moon rising on each cherry. Still life: you can\u2019t. Even the light Is mortal. Death is the bride in white ^sting first fruits of loss; the slow Ripening of cherries, blood-bright. \n￼Degas\u2019 Ecoliere It is not every day, on meeting Someone new, we have the chance To size them up as they advance And know ourselves in their retreating. Not one foot high, and a little Larger than life, your body\u2019s simple In its bronze motion; straw hat tilted A candid angle, chin lifted (perhaps A touch too high), your bag in hand, on hip, Above a thigh that flexes as you step Forward to part the air that holds you up. And I would think you less than woman Were it not for the fact that, open As your free approach may be (Breasts rounded as two firm tokens Of maturity), still you have Some small thing to hide. Oh Eve, Is it an apple you hold behind your back? As she retreats, her posture alters: Not her step, but the eye that falters Seeing sameness so utterly unlike. A girl\u2019s thin shoulders, a satchel In one hand, and in the other, crooked Up to grasp the free end of her plait, Nothing withheld - but a holding back. We are authorised to trespass. And we do. A terracotta head That has no life behind its ears Is not a head, until we make it so. I did not ask to see this last Intensely private hanging-on to Childhood, but sought it nonetheless. \n￼29/7/91 10:04 am Page 24 And the World in a Bowl of Porridge The barbed hand stops punishing. Plaited and pig-tailed, obedient as dolls, we wait, Our scored scalps tingling Where the comb had raked. Porridge steams in the breakfast bowls. Then the steady hand pouring; from jug to dish The twisted ribbon of milk; Round^d| bouldered shores the white silk slips And laps the island in. Slowly the world revolves. Then the skilled hand spooning; In one long viscous drip That measures centuries A stalactite of golden-syrup drools And spills away. Once there was an island; long ago An atoll dwindled to a scattered archipelago. In another world, on the rim of a spoon, The snail retracts its golden horn. \n￼Garrett 30/7/91 5:50 pm Page 25 Moules a la Mariniere We scoured the secret places of the creek, Parting blistered fronds of To find the concupiscent clusters, rocked In their granite creche. Jack-knives prised The molluscs out. Slick blue-blacks bruised Slowly dull; and the sea expunged our tracks. Bouquet of Muscadet, bouquet garni recall The tuck and chuckle of mussels in a bucket Behind the door. Damp and aromatic, Steam insinuates itself into all The kitchen clefts, and clings in briny beads Above the flame where mussels chirp and wheeze. I pour on wine; it seems they beg for more, The beaked shells yearning wide as if in song - Yet dumb - and lewdly lolling parrot-tongues. Cream licks the back of a spoon and drawls a slur O f unctuous benediction for this feast. We smooth our cassocks; bow our heads; and eat. It rained all night as though to wash away A brininess that tanged the atmosphere: Dreams - of forbidden fruit, offruits de mer W renched from their secret beds, of tastes that lay Like sea\u2019s after-sting on the tongue. Still lingers A trace of guilt. I wash my salty fingers. e t 25 ","docTitle":"","docDate":"1991-07-29"},"meta":{"contentType":"text/raw","emVer":"7.1.1103.5","langIdVer":"DefaultLangId","processingVer":"CalaisJob01","submissionDate":"2014-07-01 08:51:01.236","submitterCode":"57b17a53-6e34-87b0-20ff-a419896f49c9","signature":"digestalg-1|HSW8gPcXwOI3vMhQwc8FkLgsxMQ=|ROA/KCKC1M6nnk5ZLZdJ5x6BNnuOpHS50bKkYbZvIhc3CZAVWRc99w==","language":"English"}},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/36046765-b70e-3ae3-a710-b3382ab8dc87/lid/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http://d.opencalais.com/lid/DefaultLangId/English"},"http://d.opencalais.com/comphash-1/dddc8d92-72f0-377a-a86e-44a693ff990a":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"Company","name":"Garrett","nationality":"N/A","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/Company","instances":[{"detection":"[ ￼]Garrett[ 29/7/91 10:03 am Page 20 Nilak i.
