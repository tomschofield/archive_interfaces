Then glimpses of a garden or a school dormitory Shift and interchange. The frames begin to slip Quicker than I understand. I\u2019m losing my grip. Why this crowd? And why are they hunting me? Faster and faster. Suddenly I\u2019m on a promontory, The frenzy of chase closing its faceless threat. Over the edge. I\u2019ve woken in a snow of sweat. Frenchie, let\u2019s get Frenchie. Again a tableau O f schoolboy persecution sways in some undertow O f memory. I hear the swishing wavelike noise Of a mob in hot pursuit. Our ritual sacrifice. A sallow and dapper stranger weaves and dodges Down a corridor with a swarm of blurred visages Close on his heels, whipping boy and scapegoat, A swoon of oneness singling his difference out. This evening in a country that I\u2019d first come To half a life ago, some blond youths loom Up the platform, beer-cans glinting in the dark. My suspicious swarthness. A Greek or even a Turk? \u2018Is it here we trounce foreigners?\u2019 sneers a voice, Partly his show for the gang, partly his menace. An ugly moment. I hurry on trying to pretend I didn\u2019t understand, scanning exits for my friend. a -H4 \u2014 Unbroken line of pogroms, this blindman\u2019s Muff. A planet now at stake, perhaps we know enough To reveal even the slants and bias of our lens? A stark figure transverses our shed millennia, That first victim forever crying his innocence. Stay the knife. Children of a jealous violence, Fugitives on the earth, may we still ask his pardon? Say to me, brother Abel, that I\u2019m your guardian. 46 \n￼0'Siadhail 47- 5/7/95 4:27 pm Pag & BOUNDARIES Springbrunn ar du, vars solig it glittrande strale skon i sin jamvikt, skon i sin formstranga bage, skon i sin styrka, ager makten att alska granser och adla matt.

KARIN BOYE / Translated by David MeDuff \n￼O'Siadhail 47-80 5/7/95 4:27 pm Page'-48 Hopscotch Our chalkedfigure of boxes squared offand interlocked. Overlappings ofsides, t-shapes, half-shared divides. A groundwork for high jinks. 'Your go!\u2019And everyone hunkers to watch if I toe the line. Footfall vigil. Is this why the Germans call hopscotch \u2018playing a game of heaven and hell\u2019? Such passion for limits and thresholds. Johnston's shop in Pettigo, its entrances in both counties. A foot in two worlds. Abutment and frontier. Old ambivalences. Or the way sometimes exact same sounds seemed to slide and play with words; a child is riddling out how \u2018bounds' means 'confines\u2019and \u2018bouncesforwards\u2019. Then, the pivot homewards. Our swift about-face. Thrill and crisis of turning; one ankle clasped, one hand aloft, frail balance ofgravity and yearning. A skittish jump. Again our spreadeagle heavy-footed landings astride a border. Stop-go momentum of hop and straddle. That need of lines. That leap's desire. 48 \n￼O'Siadhail 47-80 5/7/95 4:27 pm Pag?--^9 Noon I\u2019ve fallen in love again with gazing. A lake is absorbing shimmered transfers of grey alders and ripplings of leaves. A hollow twig hesitates, then steers outward, canoeing this ice-age maw. M ountain eye. Basin of contemplation. A skimmed stone tumbles and disappears. Minutiae of an aeon. Noon is filling the air with its riddles. Who am I? Archaeologies of thought define me: the words I use, phrases, gestures. Is everything seen with an encoded eye? Piecemeal layers of address and response. Process of encounters: fall-out, settlings, accruals, a womb of residues and ores. Silent undertows. Still-living sediment. A mountain lake swallows and endures these slow, deep accumulations of sludge. In the dark and light of every about-face some beckoning aim, a hovering remembrance. My spirit is watching over the waters. / 49 \n￼O'Siadhail 47-80 5/7/95 4:27 pm Pag Story A man turns hostage for his friend\u2019s release: It is a far, far better pfofe that I go to... Abandon without return. Gratuity of sacrifice. Itisafar,farbetterthingthatI do... that cadenza of Dkjrfms\u2019 Tale of Two Cities and a child bursts in tears. Must it be so? One story will haunt him all his living days. The wartime girl with her German soldier flees over the frontiers. Or tell him, now as he greys, of an African spirit between one world and another who stays around as a child just to make happy the bruised face of a woman who\u2019d become his mother. M y name is made illustrious in the light o f his. To break and enter another\u2019s brokenness and glory. This is the story I\u2019ll touch in every caress. 50 \n￼Sunlight Two children swimming out to the low tide rocks and a woman watching. Breaststrokes. Headlong aspirations of dips and bobs across the water. Her lovely givenness a vigilance of substitution, hostage to every breath and splash. Stange paradox: the further they swim away, the nearer they are. \u2018That\u2019s my place in the sun\u2019 is how the usurpation ^oFthe whole world begaiQAnd I fill with wonder watching a woman watching. What is this reflex? An abandon and weightlessness of concern. Pure undergoing. Almost as if they float in the matrix of her being, drifting in passivities of creation. Some overflow of boundaries weaves its intrigues of motherhood. A debt being payed before the loan, as though she usurps herself in watching over the whirl of their busy limbs oaring back water in sunlight, the whole gown of her life turned inside out. Her face glories in this reversal. Some obsessive patience hears an ungiven order. Does an echo somehow anticipate its sound? She\u2019s so full of answers before they ever call. \n￼- Q - Slowly I wipe her brow with a sponge. It\u2019s as though \\S Two women are merging into one. I swab her hairline, Breathing and undergoing all she\u2019ll have to undergo. A sudden exhaustion seizes me. Now I watch for a sign. Maybe she\u2019s begun to doze. I leave. Sneaking. Tiptoe. I wanted to be the Samaritan pouring my oils and wine. But was I some skulking Levite abandoning her pillow? I know to serve you better I need to hold the line, Yet where that line should go, how can I ever know? Here nursing your fever will I be forever nine? You gaze a gaze that seems to say: \u2018To think it\u2019s so, To think for someone else even this face of mine Is the face of a certain man going down to Jericho.\u2019 \u2014 O'Siadhail 47-80 5/7/95 4:27 pm Pag Merging Nursing your cold\u2019s fever I\u2019m forever nine Worrying there by my mother\u2019s bedside years ago.
