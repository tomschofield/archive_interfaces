She thinks nothing moves in me But senility. But my eyes slither To take in That she herself is not young Or pretty. She sees something in me. I see her children. Little girls in petals. I slip them onto my knee. That\u2019s all I need of Kate Greenaway. The Ice House Dark ages wear white eyes, I want her Who disturbed me like ice and fire. A roundhouse surrounds a sad spell. The sorrow is palpable, It freezes doves in their tracks. This was our dovecote, A keep for the parts of us too tender To venture in the world.

We might as well live To mine the ice from our eyes. Turneresque Throw open all the windows then Where genius painted glass And mortals may walk through Without receiving A shard to the heart. The dainty white glove Has arrested the organ And doves dip their wings Strike out at canvass. Down fuels us And then the angels Who touch men Make them mad. Or yearn for the moment Between contraction And expulsion When the feathers weep. Drop beauty on the cataract Restore vision so The eye shall Move the heart. 61 ","docTitle":"","docDate":"1993-03-20"},"meta":{"contentType":"text/raw","emVer":"7.1.1103.5","langIdVer":"DefaultLangId","processingVer":"CalaisJob01","submissionDate":"2014-07-01 09:56:53.865","submitterCode":"57b17a53-6e34-87b0-20ff-a419896f49c9","signature":"digestalg-1|/li8ohT6cq5QJ+VftGgi07kqTzU=|lfIJzYaXudUVtQ8dTROJ29WV2AwNptYcLWXDwHlOpJg/yMkmOi6NRg==","language":"English"}},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/f96dca35-3b69-37e9-bec5-aeac9fc64ba3/lid/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http://d.opencalais.com/lid/DefaultLangId/English"},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/0711174c-55ff-3f08-8fd5-f66c7f70b3ba":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"Facility","name":"To mine","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/Facility","instances":[{"detection":"[ Page 6, We were born dead.
