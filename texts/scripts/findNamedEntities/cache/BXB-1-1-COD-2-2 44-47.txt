Through fire, through ghastly ash and any Smothering weight of water still we imagine A life courteous and joyful; see them lightly clad Loving the sun, the vine and the grey olive. Over the water, from trading, they come home winged With sails, their guide and harbinger the white dove. CHRONICLE I The sea suddenly stood up vertical, sky-high, Bristling with the planks of their peaceful ships. The earth roared like a bull. They said Poseidon, Breaker of lintels, was shaking them. There was fire too Glaring like a red eye. But the unkindest Was of all the four elements the purest And to breathing man his being: the air Clagged and precipitated in cankers of pumice And thereafter for weeks in a fine dust. Wherever the living air was welcome now Ash entered and the hearts of houses ceased; Their eyes, hurt by blows, were quite extinguished; Their mouths, agape, were stopped. Ash filled And softly embedded household pots, shrouded Frescoes of air-beafing dolphins. Who survived When the sun had*wept and blinked its eyesight clear Lame in the lungs saw only dust Lying now quiet as snow. One inch of such - That is from nail-end to the knuckle of the thumb - Will render infertile the fruitful, the man-nurturing earth For perhaps ten years. To them now kneeling on rock Who had salted no fields, burned no olive groves And poisoned nobody\u2019s wells, there remained no rod To sound the ells, the fathoms, the generations of ash. ---- 44 \n￼vK- The cinder. On Santorini the common people, Scratching a living in the old ash and pumice, remembered Kalliste and watched and prayed. But a scholar, A believer in Atlantis, when the steam had thinned Pulled out alone in a small boat. How great Must have been his disappointment if he thought Some glimmer of Atlantis might be vouchsafed him ncrea^e to CHRONICLE II How deep below? None of the warring nations Had length of chain to fathom at what depth Atlantis lay. Nobody anchored there. But then - In the days of death by impalement or the ganch When Christian citizens of Candia ate The besieging Turk\u2014with a roar, witnesses say, Like innumerable bulls, the sea, or the earth Under the waters, rendered up to the surface A new island, called nowadays Kaimeni, noespect f(jywho had done Giltlheir lost lovingkindness and wisdom: he saw Only black smoking slag and ash, and smelled An intimation of Christian Hell.

Lies Were ready on his tongue but he found His rescuers, his hosts, discreet or indifferent And asking nothing. Only once he was bathed And dressed in clothes held by for the occasion There was a pause, a silence, and his fear returned Imagining sacrifice. Solemnly, deferring, They led him into the church. The congregation Was the island\u2019s marriageable girls. He must choose, They said, one for his bride. Any stranger Showing himself indignant or lascivious Heard behind him the whetting of knives. The wise man Walked modestly two or three times The length of the aisle and among the girls after The heart\u2019s true inclination made his choice. A priest of the church married them there and then. Next morning early with a harder courtesy He was fetched aboard a manned ship and so Passed back into the sea-lanes. Some thus restored Put off the escapade, some boasted and some Wandered thereafter for the one bride. She According to the custom of the island was courted by the best And if she were seen to have taken the stranger\u2019s seed Then by the very best, and married in her third month. I The second husbands shone like full moons In reflected sun, their stepchildren Were called \u2018the strangers\u2019 and enjoyed Love and privileges above the rest. The boys Grew proficient with boats, eyed the horizons And one morning departed, courting shipwreck. The girls Excited a restlessness but themselves Waited, knowing they were most likely to be chosen When out of the sea one morning a salt man crawled. 46 / \n￼(T. \"JV.et'e.
