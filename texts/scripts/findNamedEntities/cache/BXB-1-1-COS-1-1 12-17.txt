Mungo red in the face, Matthew hale as a tree, John huge In old leather. The others in dribs And drabs, shotguns over their shoulders, Bags flopping at their sides, collars up. We\u2019d set out across the north park, The glaur on our leggings freezing As we left the shelter of the knowes. No dogs. Even the ferrets on this day O f days were left squealing behind Their wire. W e\u2019d fan out, taking The slope at a steady tramp. Mungo always aimed first, blasting away At nothing. Hugh cursed under his breath; The rest of us kept going. Suddenly The hares would rise from the bracken-clumps And go looping downhill. I remember The banks alive with scuts, the dead Gorse-tufts splattered with shot. One by one the haversacks filled, The blood dripping from them, staining The snow . Matthew still in front, Directing the others; the sun red Behind its dyke, the wind rising. And myself bringing up the rear, Pretending i was lost, become the quarry. Three blasts on a whistle, the second Time round. And, in from the sleet, We would settle on bales with bottles And flasks, to divide the spoils. The bodies Slit, and hung on hooks to drip. The rest Thrown smoking on the midden. The dogs Scrabbling on their chains, Todd\u2019s stallion 12 \n￼Rearing at the reek of blood. Then in To the fire and a roaring new year: Old Martha and Mima scuffling to and fro, Our men\u2019s bellies filling, hands Slowly thawing. And for me, off to bed, A pig in the sheets, the oil lamp Throwing shadows of rabbits on the wall. Last winter I covered the same ground On my own, no gun.fOM/.Martha and Mima 1lave gone to rest. Todd has tethered His horses under the hill. Mungo, too, From a fall at the baling. Yet my breathing Seemed to make their shapes; and Matthew\u2019s And Hugh\u2019s, and my own bringing up the rear. At the road-end 1 stopped and stood For some time, just listening. My hands Growing numb. Then 1 crossed the track To where a single rabbit lay twitching, lhg-headed, eyes bulging, in pain. I took the heaviest stone 1 could find; And with one blow beat in its brains. \n￼Ferret More vicious than stoat or weasel Because caged, kept hungry, the ferrets Were let out only for the kill: An alternative to sulphur and nets. Once one, badly mauled, hid Behind a treacle-barrel in the shed. Throwing me back, Matthew slid The door shut. From outside The window, 1 watched. He stood Holding an axe, with no gloves. Then it sprang; and his sleeves Were drenched in blood Where the teeth had sunk. I hear Its high-pitched squeal, The clamp of its neat steel Jaws. And I still remember How the axe flashed, severing The ferret\u2019s head, And how its body kept battering The barrels, long after it was dead. 14 \n￼In a Simple Light X Winter in this place Is a tangerin/sun. Against the skyline Nine Shetland ponies Stand like cut-outs Fraying at the edges. Snow puffs and flurries In weightless driblets As they platter downhill, Pink-hooved, chins Stitched with frost, manes Jiggling a tinsel trail. They clutter and jolt, Are pluff-bellied, biff Posts, thrum their trough With warm breathing, smelt Ice. On the skyline Again, part fancy, they Freeze. In each eye Is a tangerine sun.// H/ / 15 \n￼On Craigie Hill The farmhouse seems centuries ago, The steadings slouched under a sifting of snow For weeks on end, lamps hissing, logs stacked Like drums in the shed, the ice having to be cracked To let the shaggy cats drink. Or Back from the mart through steaming pastures Men would come riding - their best Boots gleaming, rough tweeds pressed To a knife-edge, pockets stuffed with notes. Before that even, I could visualise (from coloured Prints) traps rattling, wheels spinning; furred Figures posing like sepia dolls In a waxen world of weddings and funerals. When Todd died, last of the old-stagers, Friends of seventy years followed the hearse. Soon the farm went out of the family: the Cochranes Going to earth or, like their cousins, Deciding it was time to hit town. The last link broken, the farm-buildings stand In a clutter below the quarry. The land Retains its richness - but in other hands. Kilmarnock has encroached. It is hard to look Back with any sense of belonging. Too much has changed, is still changing. This blustery afternoon on Craigie Hill I regard remotely the muddy track My father used to trudge along, to school. 16 \n￼Farm The sun drills the shire through and through Till the farm is a furnace, the yard A quivering wickerwork of flame. Pitchforks Flash and fall. Bales are fiery ingots. Straws sputter like squibs. Stones Explode. From the byre, smack on time, Old .Martha comes clattering out With buttered bannocks and milk in a pail. Todd, his face ablaze, swims back In what shadow there is. Hugh and John Stretch out among sheaves. Hens squabble For crusts; a dog flicks its tail At a cleg; blueflies bunch like grapes. Still the sun beats down, a hammer On tin. AndTiigh overhead vapour-trails Drift seaward, out past Ailsa Craig. t 17 ","docTitle":"","docDate":"2014-07-01 08:49:30.224"},"meta":{"contentType":"text/raw","emVer":"7.1.1103.5","langIdVer":"DefaultLangId","processingVer":"CalaisJob01","submissionDate":"2014-07-01 08:49:28.680","submitterCode":"57b17a53-6e34-87b0-20ff-a419896f49c9","signature":"digestalg-1|5F9zuWZY6MpiuMVCDwLsdzFeEEE=|i7MUSu9ttCxAMeLKU9SaX3U6GT01QUFI0LXCwhlfnCoka9aVn72Qag==","language":"English"}},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/0742d52d-a57e-3990-8c2f-8787dde45417/lid/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http://d.opencalais.com/lid/DefaultLangId/English"},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/e8dd5ecd-f9fc-3445-bce3-57d2da2867e5":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"Technology","name":"Flash","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/Technology","instances":[{"detection":"[ yard A quivering wickerwork of flame.
