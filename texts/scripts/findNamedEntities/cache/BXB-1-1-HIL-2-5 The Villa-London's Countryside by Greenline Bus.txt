A few birds were absent-mindedly picking through the mangled remains of small children, and a gold dog ran in and out of the empty cabin, cradling a spotted quince in its mouth. The man we were looking for was lying on a day-bed under a red tree. He seemed to be having some problem with his skin, and was wearing a pair of white silk gloves and a white blood-stained hat. He was the only survivor able to speak and even he was too weak to talk for more than a few minutes at a time. He was an ex-oil-pipe-contractor and a millionaire who had been looking for a place to breed orchids ...and as he spoke he lay back on the bleached canvas of his ancient bed, his eyes beginning to run, his limp white penis resting in the sunlight on his glove. While my colleague went in search of a blanket, I listened to the gunfire from the valley, where my daughter lay awake behind closed curtains guarded by sweet machines like a rare flower. 136 ©- -e- \n￼The Runway As days,then weems,went by, my fears increased. Once a hare was taken from a trap; once I heard the crunch of a boot. Finally,late one afternoon, walking back along bhe upper bank, I saw a swimmer swim across the lake. I watched him for a little while in silence, then gathered stones and stoned him steadily until he disappeared without a trace, and silence re-established itself - silence,and the memory of Mother, zipped up in her nylon sleeping-bag, dragging herself slowly like a foot across the tarmac with a scraping sound. \n￼Hill Trembling 95-123 3/2/94 12:29 pm © ge 97 Lilies of the Valley The flying-helmet my late father wore smells of seals, cloud-banks, German blood. I stand in silence, shouldering a broom. At night I draw huge maps in the mud. We stay indoors. We dye our jeans and hair. We sew black lace round everything we wear. We soak our feet in bowls of turpentine. Our knickers twinkle like a diamond mine. Office-workers watch us from their windows coil like a snake around the square. NAGASAKI SMELT OF BURNING PIGLETS. He wants to sink his lips into my hair. As soon as I appear my mother knows. She throws away my banners and my jeans. I said I \u2019ll marchfor everfor this garden, this lily-of-the-valley, this white rose. I\u2019m dancing on the air-base with Teresa. Her father will be furious. She is blind. Beneath the planes, beside the muddy river, we\u2019re waiting for the march to move again. LOST CHILDREN. Sheena Easton quietly singing. Three vicars mend a Trident in the rain. I \u2019ve got little ones myself, the airman said, his uniform as cold and metallic as lilies-of-the-valley; panic; tin. \n￼Hill Trembling 95-123 3/2/94 12:29 pm © -ge 98 \\ I live on bread the nurses leave in bowls, while in my dreams the bullets turn to bees: I feel the sunshine rub against my thighs, the drip drip drip ofhoney in the trees. cur 98 / \n￼Hill Trembling 95-123 3/2/94 12 :29 p m ^ Sage 99 L Tomato Soup I We have to be like this because we\u2019re strangers. The bear I had at school - I want it now. Its felted ear-lobes satisfied my lips. II The nurses call Night-night to the patients who hold their pink and yellow cake like cards. I keep on thinking of their little fingers, their little fingers half way up my skirt. III The smell of apples chills the empty house; the ghostly cows that wait below the window crunch the ice like liver. I\u2019m alone. IV The sea beyond the rail slips in and out its fringe of sandy foam like melted lies. Of course I think of you. The path is narrowing. I don\u2019t know where I am, or who\u2019s the nurse.

And as they sped away across the valley, I saw the children picking up the rabbits and making for the cover of the wood. Some of the rabbits were almost the size of sheep, and the children were gradually sinking into the snow, but when a man came running past, I followed him. I didn\u2019t even turn to wave goodbye. The orange is exactly the same, like certain orange fungi, or small moths. (W/e were terrified of everything in those days, even, I remember, those small moths. The children hung long nets across their windows so they didn\u2019t have to hear the velvet heads banging in the night against the glass.) / e 103 \n￼Sugared Almonds Hank was sweet, but wasn\u2019t used to children, so when I came, I had to put him down. And then he said the dog I got instead had mauled, in fact had killed, his little girl. So that poor dog was put to sleep as well. You might say fair enough but my point is this girl was an imaginary girl. I was employed, and given proper money, to care for no one. She was non-existent. At first I tried to sympathise with him, but after that, well, frankly, it\u2019s not easy. I loved those dogs. Hank never left my side. A beautiful sweet-natured White Bull Terrier. My sugared almond. That\u2019s what he was like. Not only his coat, but even his lovely smell. I smelt them on my father so I know. Almost like mahogany. Or chestnuts. Chestnut and chocolate roulade, slightly warmed, and mixed with a mixture of cream and Grand Meunier. Harry was her name, the daughter\u2019s. Harriet. A spoilt little thing she was too. She treated me as if I was her servant. Do this, do that all day. It never stopped. All her father had to do was read to her. A bedtime story. When he finished work. He used to sit up there for hours some nights, telling her the most fantastic stories even I was spellbound by. It\u2019s true. More and more fantastic. In the end we had to stop because it made us cry. \n￼wi'ffC -Q - J Molly \u2018Possible titles: HAPPINESS: GRIEF: MY CROW.\u2019 That\u2019s what it said, in tiny screwed-up handwriting that only I could follow, and maybe her mother, who wrote her the long intriguing letters I was on my word of honour not to read. We used to come up here most afternoons. Stacey would sit^on her pillow, and, taking a lock of white hair between her fingers, would flick up the ends in a bunch and examine them, like a monkey. She had a pai^pf scissors in the shape of a sick-looking stork that she would snip them off withr frowning? She would carry on like this all afternoon, as if her hair were a goddess she must serve!

By the time we reached the chalet, War and Peace was finished, and then she complained of having nothing to do. She sat under her duvet like a pope, asking for \u2018a good novel\u2019, and ignoring the Sunne-Bliime Tee we offered her instead. My mother got more and more gloomy, and j^ e up her plan of yodelling across the Inn at midnight. My poor mother - she was trying to get over her affair with H. Novels made her feel worse. Her favourite book was London\u2019s Countryside By Greenline Bus and, recently, that great mountaineering classic, Pilgrimage to Nanga Parbat. She liked the way the climber talks about the Clear Voice that he hears; and when he sits, high above a nullah, eating the last of his sausage, he feels the mountain watching every mouthful, like a dog. My mother could just imagine it. Fliichthom: mountain. Inn: river. Sunne-Bliime Tee: tea made from dried flowers. /132 Cut ft1'' \\ L CL__ -Q - + '\"7 ","docTitle":"","docDate":"1994-03-02"},"meta":{"contentType":"text/raw","emVer":"7.1.1103.5","langIdVer":"DefaultLangId","processingVer":"CalaisJob01","submissionDate":"2014-07-01 09:53:47.589","submitterCode":"57b17a53-6e34-87b0-20ff-a419896f49c9","signature":"digestalg-1|1wV8NQzSIsXs2y4diYUJbgSpqVg=|JeFf9b90XaoxSQ5Rm26TsnERNXF1K/AiXBwP3MFZbFAAplzYaG8F1w==","language":"English"}},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/6ce400d7-5eff-3b45-980f-00512fe439f6/lid/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http://d.opencalais.com/lid/DefaultLangId/English"},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/6c5b6b93-0583-34b6-86ba-cafbf5cf6289":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"IndustryTerm","name":"e - ge","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/IndustryTerm","instances":[{"detection":"[\n￼-U- Hill Trembling 95-123 3/2/94 12:33 pm ]e - ge[ 123 \\\\Deep in the Scented House Deep in the]","prefix":"\n￼-U- Hill Trembling 95-123 3/2/94 12:33 pm ","exact":"e - ge","suffix":" 123 \\\\Deep in the Scented House Deep in the","offset":9510,"length":6}],"relevance":0.071},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/31ec6404-85fe-33f5-af02-cb37fec6b170":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"IndustryTerm","name":"oil","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/IndustryTerm","instances":[{"detection":"[more than a few minutes at a time.
