Her poems have already appeared in many magazines. She read a poem in the toilets at the Ritzy for a recent BBC Talent 2000 documentary, and was a Poetry Review \u2018New Poet of \u201996\u2019. Clare Pollard wrote most of these poems while still at school in Bolton. She is now 19, much too young, perhaps, to expect anyone to take her seriously, but young enough to question that assumption and much else besides. Her poems are fresh and energetic, barbed with a modern girl\u2019s natural cynicism, but tempered with open- eyed hope as well as wry acceptance. In The Heavy-Petting Zoo, the male of the species is shown in all his preening glory, his growling and posturing exposed but also given marks out of ten. The book gives us the world according to Clare Pollard, an insider\u2019s in-your-face portrayal of the tarnished lives of today\u2019s bright young things. This is work you can\u2019t ignore - raw, reckless and more bloody-minded than an older, so- called wiser poet would dare to be.

It is impossible to harm dunes, or bruise winds, or burn sun. Desert air is thick with mirage, so the Bedouin breathe dreams and move, keep moving, not letting home, that heavy-hooked numbness, catch them. And the stars? The stars in the desert are utterly indifferent to me \u2014 so much so that I think I may fall in love with stars, those cold-eyed maps which guide me towards newness. Do not need me, I need you to leave my body untended, my skin naked and unkissed beneath the dry, valueless gold. \n￼Everything Ends in Ice The day that I met you was the first day of sun. I was shiny and new. You thawed me in an hour; made me mute as a flower - all good clean fun. As I bit through peach fur my longing for you grew. Always knew you loved her, yet got grazed climbing trees as you swarmed me like bees. I sweated you. Starved of sun, nothing grows, and rain was all I got. Watched my dreams decompose, and lit trees doused in fuel. You were Halloween-cruel. You let me rot. Now, I\u2019m cold as a corpse. My heart is blank with frost. Skies are bleak as my thoughts; and this numbness could slice as I swallow the ice and I am lost. \n￼The Heavy-Petting Zoo It\u2019s your best friend\u2019s 16th birthday party. That\u2019s eight hamster lives, and yet she still wasn\u2019t wise enough to realise it would turn into a heavy-petting zoo. Let\u2019s put it this way - you wouldn\u2019t bring the family, and there\u2019s an awful lot of stroking going on. The lounge crawls with muzzy, fuzzy pubic mice. You want to hibernate, but every bedroom is locked. (That soft-haired girl from the Shetlands is offering rides.) You could have been a part of it - for a small price at the door you could have had them eating out of your hand by now, felt that breathy, hot nuzzle-lick, but instead you\u2019re floundering in your own sour vinegar juices, like a sick terrapin. The other girls are beautiful and brittle chicks, eggs precarious and smashable in the cups of their bras, and he\u2019s with her somewhere. They\u2019re probably mewling cutely at each other, or else she\u2019s stripped and pink as a piglet and they\u2019re at it like rabbits. It\u2019s sickeningly bestial. You hope they get myxomatosis. Yet in your small child\u2019s heart you know that if he\u2019d called you, you\u2019d have followed him as she did. As a lamb does, whitely and without question. r 13 \n￼Zaghruda I try not to recall the darkest times for fear that hate will rot away my womb Khun mae mon Soeur daughter Yes - we touch long desire feel ache also yet you branded us whores huren In the brothel the harem (skirts up round our thighs) we lay back and thought of kuche - centre of our world jollof rice dumplings bamii nam lasagna basturma At the suk we purchased food for you with given coins sari izar veil tarha They smothered us We saw but were not seen Invisible people devoured by night I heard of one Asian who killed herself When you laughed and laughed at the meadows of soft dark hair on her limbs We pasted lead on our skin to make us bleich for you You liked us cripples our feet golden lilies No ambitions but for you master whilst you said come on darling sweetheart dog querida sweet potato pie In Borneo menstruating women must sit on the roof for three days Defloration may involve a sharp stone or a fist wrapped in cloth And of course we love the stink of baby crap! We want to pluck our brows until we weep You sucked our milk then spat it in our faces The other week Iran was on the news Men mutilated their own flesh for Islam At first I cried with joy to see they had caused themselves to suffer also Hallelujah! Fierce sang rouge dripping 14 kitten r Yed mae \n￼Only then I saw their wounds were as deep as ours Saw the pained desperate smiles as they tried to be strong Three men died that day Oh brother padre sohn lover We anoint your cuts with yaah saneh through choice Forgiveness is easy between equals Take our hand and we\u2019ll love you Poor sad Don Juan I know we can survive this together \n￼The Bridesmaid I trail behind the bride, watch the dip of the lace at her waist; a braille I could trace with my thumb. The bouquets, which smell as the skin at the back of her neck must, are beautifully done. Violets for violence. Her gentlest touch can bruise me, as I cannot stop my blood from racing to meet her, clamouring to press against the merest brush of sleeve in a tender flood. Her ivory straps are biting her back and I long to slip fingers between her body and them. I have to clutch hard on the flowers to stop myself reaching, and slice up my lovesick hands on rose stems. Roses for the razor she shaved her calves with this morning; as I watched blossoms she dripped in the sink. Through steam, as I painted my nails, she talked about love, how much she was in it, and him, and what did I think? And the hand which slips a ring on her is not even shaking. It sickens with anger, this body which has obeyed love now for a year, which knows every colour her hair can turn in the light, and is achingly always her maid. 17 \n￼The Butcher\u2019s Cat Butcher, butcher, hack me some meat. Our poor cat is weak and needs the blood; for you\u2019ve drained him, drained him, neutered and tamed him, fed him with scraps and with saucers of milk. Yes, you stroke him with affectionate fingers; but he saw you SAW that cow in two. He\u2019sseen whatyou do to the other animals, butcher-man. On some hot nights he\u2019s watched you tiptoe in fresh from the slaughter-house - stinking of iron, an anaemic\u2019s wet-dream; with your blood-drenched boots squealing on the tiles. He saw the way you fed that hen with best corn, gave it a name, and then wrung its neck, as though it had called your mother a slut. Butcher, butcher I am sick, real sick of the obscure cuts you bring me - heart, tongue, sweetmeats; and that stripey apron that you wear, and the way you like your steak so rare. I get MAD when I peer through the grime of your windows and see the naked limbs - like fragments of disembodied porn-stars. 18 You pimp death. \n￼And I feel the same fear as our dear pet, for at night in our big white bed, stuffed to sickness with sausage; I have noticed you feel my breast as though it were a pound of good turkey. Measuring its leanness, valuing the meat. One day soon I will pick up my cat and run, from you, butcher-man, and your mince. Your stun-gun. Oh, you say that you would never EAT us \u2014 but I have heard that in France they eat Horse. 19 \n￼Keyf 7 tumble onto my divan and am soon fast asleep, morn out with the exertion I have not even made.' HALIDE EDIP Beside the menagerie, amongst roses and jasmine nude women play tag. Skin is yoghurt, arms marrows, breasts eggplants. A pearl, a ruby - these things mean nothing. Are a single dive through blue beneath the whetted eye of a Sultan. It is the scraps that obsess their hearts - a match; a peppercorn; a slice of pear. These mean a love that must be silent, not his sort of love - a love you share with those sticky sweet things - lips of the beauty; ladies\u2019 thighs; woman\u2019s navel. The ice in their delicate sherbets has come seventy miles, and is mixed with pansies, violets. And is mixed with musk to 20 \n￼smother the stink of nothing. They no more speak truth than the guard with his slit tongue. The difference is that their tongues glitter with crushed lapis lazuli; pulverised pearl. Kismet is cured with a little yellow pill, opiates gild their fates - it is said those poppies are white as each face they blanch with almond paste; corrode with smoothing arsenic. And in the end, sisters? In the end even love ends with a slice of a scimitar, or getting stuffed in a sack. Their veils are an act! Pretending they have something to hide, when their lives are gazing through windows then bathing off sky. There\u2019s always hope of course. Did you hear about the eunuch who found it had grown back? The magic here is black; they\u2019d train macaws to cackle lies to be mistress of robes, the keeper of the baths. Each coffee could be poison. In cliques, they plot their silent war. \n￼Attempt at a Beautiful Poem I wanted this poem to be beautiful for you. Longed madly to say pretty things, but from this cafe window I can only see neon shop signs that hum like migraines, and people sagged beneath them, hunched from carrying broken plastic bags full of whisky, beans, toilet tissue and tinned ravioli. Those chip-trays could be said to dance like butterflies, but the bitter milk oozing from crushed dandelions, however hard I try, can only make me think of pus. Women tread delicately round dog shit, weeping black tears for their fetid thighs, And because Soldier, Soldier was so moving last night. I could pretend the rain was glistening quicksilver, but it beats rotting chips to a greasy pulp. Pummels the man\u2019s pasty flesh to bruises like those on the peaches that roll off market stalls and decay on the drenched, dark tarmac; until it would not surprise anyone to see a maggot squirm out of his shin. I so wanted to give you a poem that was beautiful, but somehow I know that promises of licking you calm as a sleep-deep ocean, and sap-sticky kisses in forests, and fists full of stars are not going to work this time. 22 \n￼V alentine We always come, dumb with longing. We come in our thousands \u2014 dressed in pink for shame; slow-dancing in same- sex couples. We are not the broken-hearted - that\u2019s the worst of it. No excuse but our inadequacy, as we choke on ginseng, honey, the stinking truffles Madame de Pompadour swore by. Paper hearts flap in the draught. Body language, rose quartz, spells, charms, laughing at every fucking thing that he says... All false hope, like the card your mother posts you. I cannot bear this stench of tuberose, pheromones, fingers. To want something is to know I cannot have it. February leaks its gluey juices; bleeds over everything. \n￼Dream of Explosions This is not feverish flamenco fire devouring my home like a loaf - this is a margarine candle flame. Enough light to read by. This is not a black hole. Nothingness so intense it thirsts for me - this is a vacuum flask full of tea for two. This is not drowning. Becoming a terrible bird as the ocean vomits into me - this is a soothing lukewarm bath to cure my aching joints. This is not an earthquake. The world\u2019s old wounds torn open again, like a bad case of scurvy - this is the peel torn from a tangerine. A good dose of vitamin C. I am the cat that got the milk. Woman who awoke in a warm bed on a black-ice morning, and never got up again. My life is nice. I raise a mild smile. Yes, I dream of explosions that shake my bones loose, but what if this is the most violent? W hat if this is it, my childhood dream? I cannot let it go for a whiff of gunpowder. If I stand in a lonely, open field trying to catch lightning bolts, perhaps I\u2019ll only catch my death of cold. Oh, but if I caught that bolt and sparked the world bulb bright! Should I settle for this current that keeps my TV running, but little more? 24 \n￼Angel Song This fir-tree point could impale. I balance on it, praying for still skies. Fingertip bulbs in cracked coloured cases fuse, and threaten to burn my skirts. Shiny, red apples decompose on nooses. Pine cones are sprayed with crunched-mirror glitter. Sometimes it is thrilling. This sparkle, this lack of roots. Only the others hate me. Cry out that I am no better than them, it\u2019s just my wings are sprayed with gilt and a halo on a pin skewered through my scalp. But I earned that jet of golden paint! I suffered as the pin pierced my soft plastic head, and unlike them, I cannot make mistakes. An imperfection and I will be torn from this tree. I cannot be bitter like a gift of myrrh, or they\u2019ll say: \u2018Who does she think she is? Tied to the spike as if it is a crucifixion.\u2019 I am a seasonal decoration, pretty - but I will not bring salvation. Tinsel is not real silver, you know, just foil that moults off strips; and nobody can join me up here. What am I but a detail in this small beige room? An afterthought in an outfit made from someone\u2019s old wedding dress. These needles bring not sleep, just little hurts. O, to have a Bethlehem to go to. To be deep filled, like a mince pie. Father Christmas, give me wings that work. I am so tired of trying to rival snowflakes. 25 \n￼Registering Her Complaint A dream holiday, the brochure said, but in her dreams the toilet flushes. She\u2019s irritable as a queen whose gown is made of mosquitoes. An unripe gecko scurries from her wrath. The brochure, she is almost sure, did not inform her it was monsoon season, the dark trees strung up with liquid fairy-lights, and though it did not say what sort of breakfast was included, what sort of breakfast is dribbling chunks of violet melon, mango, papaya, fresh lychees like turtle eggs? English people expect an English breakfast - fat-streaked bacon. Scraping-filled sausages. Tea. Today she was hoping to lie on the beach, Aphrodite in nylon knickers, her sweating breasts strawberry mousses, offending the natives. Instead they are registering her complaint. Butterflies huge as bats flap clumsily past the foyer, as the ceiling fan lazily thumps the still air. There was a snake in that bottle of wine, she tells Them, and in another a rat-foetus - she had nightmares. The receptionist thinks of his two mud rooms, the way his daughter begged a biro off a stranger, and sleeps clutching it. Arranges for this woman to transfer out of Paradise. The heat sucks on her like a cigarette. Her dull eyes dismissing the orchids that are exploding like invulnerable fireworks in the damp air, she informs a fellow white there is pressure - a storm tonight. This at least is something. 26 / \n￼Breakfast Poem I am egg-shell fragile and grapefruit sour. My face blotchy; eyes raisins soaked in booze. I stench of night-sweat, am too tired to shower, to scrub off each ingrained mascara bruise. Memories slice up my still-sleeping head, the morning paper does not bring good news. I\u2019m strawberry-jam sickly; I\u2019m bacon dead. It\u2019s always morning when the ghosts appear - they haunt my toaster and they burn my bread, they say I stink as stale as last night\u2019s beer. They laugh with glee to know I burned inside, once aware that your skin was tasting-near. I had no resistance; I had no pride. Confessed my love, then watched you turn to run. Now my egg tastes salt from tears I\u2019ve cried, my soldiers are charred black. No war is won. I try to weigh my loss against my gain: I have lost uncertainty, face and sun  rise. I\u2019ve gained a hangover; a dull pain. We\u2019re out of milk. My party dress is stained. \n￼A Friday Night at the End of a Millennium On the first of January in the year 2000 I will be twenty-one. Yes, I am a woman of the next millennium; star on the clean black. Our hope for the future, but I don\u2019t give a fuck as I check my pocket: purse, lipstick, rape alarm; and I\u2019m out for the night in a town where only rain glitters. Air slits up my wrists as I head for the pub. Tottering on thin heels, a cripple. We get a seat by the TV screen. Neck squirming-sour vodka and tonics; pose with Budweiser bottles. Soon we are watching Casualty with no sound on. I get cheese and onion crisps. We gossip to convince our veins they are not stagnant with boredom. The room looks like our lounge; oak beams and a mock-Turkish carpet. It is full of men who look as though they\u2019d play dominoes given half a chance, one winks at me - And I sneer the sneer of the young and slim. He could cut his fist on me. The week\u2019s blunt misery dissolves with the salt off the peanuts. 28 \n￼My mate\u2019s called Kerry and she\u2019s game for anything. Slept with three Ouzo-slick Greeks on holiday this summer - sticky one-night stands, and she\u2019s not ashamed. No, she\u2019s proud as can be, flashing blurred pictures of her topless. Him fumbling in his pocket for a spare condom. At ten we head for the club. It\u2019s symbolically underground. I order a pint for a pound, sit on a cracked back chair and begin to get intoxicated. My ex is here selling cannabis to pre-pubescent girls with ultra-bras, pierced noses, plum hair and nicotine-gilded fingers. He is beautiful, an angel in some lights. He laughs at everyone, and is too clever for this world; fingers greasy with lightly salted puppy fat. He sweats; snorts vodka until his nose bleeds prettily. Laughs some more, then makes a pass at me on the stairs. Shit, he is beautiful, but he only wants me to prove he gets what he wants - so I push him away. \n￼The only boy I ever liked to kiss. It makes me sad but proud. I have won. I will learn to live without his static lips, the warm dark sparks that danced softly off his fingers down my spine. Dizzy with the punch of winning, I dance. Jump up and down like I\u2019m tied to this rotten ceiling with elastic. I swing my hips, and lick my lips - they are dry with cider, flavoured with salt and hard-jawed smiles. I enjoy dancing. There is a kind of freedom in it, energy pounding out of my hunched-up joints. From the floor I watch a boy who told me he thinks I am very attractive - but he\u2019s sleeping with her now. The big commitment - get them in bed and they\u2019re caged. Hooked. Can\u2019t wriggle free. His hair is chilli-red, his eyes fish scales, his smile a small boy\u2019s. I used to get giddy when I saw him - 30 \n￼Now I just feel weighted. Tired. My bones will shatter like peanut brittle or barley sugar or some other crap sweet. Another pint, and they charge me two pounds this time - they must have seen me staggering, but I\u2019m too drunk to care. Alcohol goes straight through me. The girls\u2019 loos are full of lads smoking joints, so I have to piss quietly, hovering over the bowl as though I\u2019m a hummingbird in order to avoid diseases. Stale urine. Someone\u2019s bloody tampon goads me redly. I read the sign on the toilet door, itsays: \u2018avoid unwanted PREGNANCY - USE A TELEPHONE.\u2019 Oh, that used to make us laugh when this bitter-dark club seemed new; when this tongue-moist air didn\u2019t catch in my throat like a wishbone. I always wish for something utterly impossible: lager that hasn\u2019t been watered down, a star, him. The poor wish fairies - I am expecting miracles! It isn\u2019t fair on them. This bad luck is my own responsibility. \n￼It is my own fault, I take all the blame. I vow to aim lower and stop thinking I\u2019m the fucking second coming, then pull up my silk copping-knickers. Stumble out, eyes greyed by a gauze of yeast. Mirror, mirror on the wall, says I\u2019m the biggest dog of all. My flaws glow vivid. nuclear white light strips my skin off and leaves the true-me clean. A regular ugly sister. Leaves me like a plucked turkey; face withered and swollen with heat, lips just a parched outline. My arms are gorilla hairy in the brightness. My lip is bald, because I scorched off the hair before I came out, with a cream that claimed to be rose but stank of shit. My armpits are stubbly jutting caves. I put deodorant on after shaving and they stung as though wasps had built nests in the coves of dark, moist calcium. I have a good itch of my bikini line, readjust my hair - it\u2019s sucked sweet sticky. One lad is trying on his girlfriend\u2019s eyeshadow. Having a good laugh. It makes me sick-green to see them crackling with happiness; 32 \n￼force a smile when a man in skin-tight army pants offers to lick it all off of me for free. Looking down, I notice my thighs are exposed. Our skirts get shorter every week. My knickers playing hide and seek! A boy approaches, he is unremarkable, but at least I feel no nausea. I may go with him to enhance my pitiful total of boys kissed so far. Only I\u2019ve done that before - and it leaves me soiled. The sickening unfamiliarity of strange tongues; moist muscle choking you. A heaving of flesh with a bruised bud texture that tastes of vinegar or, worse, tea-time hot pot. Dead meat or apples that have browned for months. And it either chokes you - suffocates as though you\u2019ve swallowed an Asda bag; or they\u2019re gentle and sloppy - slobbering dog-like over your chin, your neck, your upper lip. Giving you a wet moustache. Snail slime slippery 34 \n￼and filling your throat with its unknown glue-juice until you want to hide slug pellets behind your lower teeth. If you\u2019re lucky they\u2019ll just move their tongue in circles - as though they are drawing balloons or coins with it. The monotony dulls your senses and loosens your jaw. You want to eat him - not through lust but for the thrill of his head in your gullet. Blood spurting brightly from his warm neck vein, and you\u2019d swallow it like medicine. At least then it would be over. Their stubble grazes your chin, until it feels as your knees did when you fell on stony ground as a child. And if you open your eyes \u2014ugh! Lids curtain-closed with bliss as though they\u2019re on a train to Paradise, when you\u2019re feeling queasy and are itching to get free. Their indignity is distasteful, their knowledge of your precious mouth. You want to slap them. Burn all official records of their being. Their pleasure and shut-eyed fun is a sick joke - they think you like them! It is at times like that I realise what an ugly word \u2018snogging\u2019 is. 35 \n￼Sometimes, I find myself Looking around - that\u2019s the killer. Suddenly, you care what everyone thinks; blush rare-beef pink. Roast hotly with the realisation he is not cool, or handsome, and his character is dubious - this boy who has his salivary glands pumping for you. Who you are sharing spit with. And you cringe, wince, try to arrange your hair differently so nobody will recognise you. You and this grotesque, macabre, bladdered freak. The one with his hands on your thighs, your back, the nape of your neck. He even tries to cop a good feel up your top - the nerve of him to think you are in his league. On his level. Not too special to touch. Anyway, I decide not to go with him. Laugh for a while as a blond, gay Goliath licks a hard stripe down my homophobic male mate\u2019s cheek. My ex reappears, now vitriolic and revenge-bent; picks on my sparkly shoes, and the way I\u2019ve mislaid my purse. 36 \n￼Flirts violently with other lager blondes before my same stale face, trying to make me cry boozily, how little he knows me! I never break, but am strong as cartilage. Look, my legs flex as though made of Lights flutter like dying butterflies in the hot whisky crush. I am no one, smudged. A happy blur. \u2018Are you okay?\u2019 someone asks, and I nod cow-like. Look at my watch but see no time, no movement. Kerry\u2019s in the corner fumbling jumpily with a lad, legs clenched tightly round him. People stare a bit, giggling, then give her a round of applause when she comes up for air. She reddens, but not much, for she loves attention. Adores a starring role. Oh, she is a wild-child! I look shocked, for it pays to humour her. See, even drunk I am condescending! People stomp on my feet. Rip my tights with careless, skeletal fingers. \n￼They are trying to destroy me! I thumb the hole until it gapes. A moon made of lightly downed thigh flesh. The gold of the hairs shimmers. Magic dust. Then they stand erect like little warriors, and I feel like a hermaphrodite, and cover it guiltily as though it is a ripped hymen. It is cold in here. So cold I would gasp, had I the will power or the energy. A consuming coldness. I am a dead foetus dunked in a lab-jar of ice water. Exposed and raw, and I can\u2019t feel my pulse, just the throbbing of a headache coming on. Oh, it hurts - and they\u2019ve started playing that terrible Prodigy song. You know, the one that goes I've got the remedy, but only makes me long for Paracetamol. My stomach churns - that last pint tipped me over. My mouth is dry as a burnt moth. 38 \n￼I perch on the radiator. Watch my hand clenching and opening in the darkness. A sea anemone. I watch all the people. The ones who will dance into the glorious sunrise with me. The ones who will kick-start a new, shining era. The leaders of men who will gush like fresh blood into the next century. Sacrificial lambs. The whitest of white; the brightest flames. They are joking about blow jobs. They are inventing nasty names for one another - like Trout Eyes. They are spilling Newcastle Brown down their Adidas three-stripe tops and beckoning people who scare them in broad daylight. Adjusting spiked hair and gold hooped eyebrows in the mirrors of dull alcoholic lemonade bottles. And kissing. Fingering each other\u2019s writhing maggot bodies as though they were cut-glass or braille or made of flowers. \n￼They are glugging down doubles with competitive grins. Shimmying round the shattered shards of smashed pint mugs that blossom. An ice web. They are vomiting a cocktail of bitter and bile on the threadbare stairs. So many people and they all only want to be loved. Funny isn\u2019t it? How all could love fiercely if they only got the chance, But they won\u2019t. It\u2019s sad. Like spilt lager. Like the taxi ride home. 40 \n￼Surrender Sometimes you are so raw \u2014 salted eyes crackling; heart bruised to a huge rotten plum; your back flayed as a galley-slave\u2019s \u2014 that you have to stop the slow dance and sit down. Sometimes you have to accept that you\u2019ve been months now underwater, and no one is going to press their mouth against your mouth, and halt the airless agony of your collapsed lungs. You say you must try, or can\u2019t wake and feel alive, but there are other, quieter ways of living \u2014 some Buddhist monks can so slow down their hearts that they almost seem dead. They claim to be content. Sometimes you have to wave something white; resisting the temptation to use a bra, or other underclothes, or a freshly laundered strait-jacket, and instead choosing something quite serious: a square with no yielding curves, cloth cut from the blanket you bought for the bridal bed. And that delicious moment when your mind, muddled from sleeplessness, drink or swelling caused by beating your desperate head against walls, desks, the bathroom tiles, thinks for a second, perhaps maybe they might be possibly yours \u2014 there comes a time when the scars that cover your body in a web of startling pain distract you too much for even this to be a pleasure. There is no redemption, or balm, or daylight. Sometimes you must just be grateful for a resolution. Do not look on it as giving up, for there is nothing to give up. Sometimes the story does end with two people in separate rooms, and one not even realising this matters. 41 \n￼Light Entertainment Commissioning a sit-com is an awful lot of work, so God created me instead - what a sadistic jerk! Right now he\u2019s sat in Heaven on his fluffy white bean-bag, with cans of beer and kettle-chips, and probably a fag. As tears roll down his ancient beard, his belly shakes with mirth. He\u2019s laughing his huge heart out at the joke I\u2019ve been from birth. Last night a classic episode - I\u2019d gone to have a wee when my Dad\u2019s friend walks in the room. There goes my dignity! I spilt my drink, I burnt the eggs, I picked up a verruca. Forgot to set the video for Friends, and lost at snooker. And what great comic timing then to hit me with love\u2019s darts! I thought perhaps my luck had changed - forgot that stooge, my heart. That stale old joke: I fail with bloke! This show has lost its spark. These same sick gags are wearing thin. God\u2019s humour\u2019s just too dark. 42 \n￼Bangkok Thousands of monks like burning clementines heads smooth and shiny as mud puddles. Thousands of male tarts, slender and painted - with eyelashes to make me envious. Thousands of people on bicycles. Tricycles. Mopeds and tuk-tuks. Cars and taxis. Riding on elephants. Travelling by foot. Pouring out of incense-heavy buildings like a fleshy discharge. Clotting up the crossroads and the junctions like scabs. Even on the murky mushroom river with its glorious stink, they pile onto the ferry boats until they look like they will sink. Heaving. Breathing. Yards of skin that smells of lemongrass. Once, led past the small, hot stalls - full of steaming satay and coconut milk I was taken to a temple made of marble, gold and jade; within which, in sticky coolness, they laid deep pink lotus flowers, uniform as folded linen napkins at the altar as gifts. \n￼Smiling, our guide said: \u2018There are no individuals in this world. We are all part of the same great spirit. When you can accept this and become part of everything - then you will reach Nirvana.\u2019 But I screamed: \u2018No! I am an individual. No one else thinks these thoughts I have. Nobody looks just like I look. Separate and removed - I am no part of you! I am special. I am different. I am me! Me! Me!\u2019 Apparently, I fainted then. They brought me round with tiger-balm and curries so hot I wept, but their kindness no longer seemed so selfless. Drug-happy on the morphine of Buddha\u2019s fat smile, they did not understand when I begged for solitude. When I told them I would rather be the only orchid in this city, than a wet, pink cell inside the cheek of a goddess. 44 \n￼Losing Control The bank is all sluggish veined marble, silence and grandeur, a horrible church. \u2018Are you saying your cash-card is stolen?\u2019 Eyes grey as incinerated five-pound notes gaze on me in disappointment. \u2018No, lost,\u2019 I confess, a sinner, through the glass. It seems I lose everything these days \u2014 keys, dignity, pool games, nerve, the ring my Grandmother left me. The staff are bowed and hushed before computer screens as though in prayer. I am passive as a two pence piece, passed around, dull from fingers. I have lost control. Hunched over the toilet as though sheltering from a holocaust, I dribbled sick, that sweet yolk, down my chin and blouse last night. \u2018Name?\u2019 My dry lips clamp on absence. Footsteps are gunshots through pillows. I am suddenly six again, bawling redly, alone in the supermarket. And the people who are queuing to receive coins like communion wafers, stare greedily. \u2018Name?\u2019 Through hallowed quiet her voice echoes like the tannoy did that day: \u2018We have a small, frightened blonde girl here, can someone please come to claim her.. \n￼Still Life I have taken up painting since I fell in love with you, as my hands are quite desperate for something to do. Still lifes mainly, as it makes me impossibly grateful to gaze on something beautiful until my eyes are full - you always run from me whilst I\u2019m still hungry to stare. It\u2019s a common misconception that there\u2019s just fruit there; no, my canvases are laden with longing and lust. Desire aches a gloss of sweat into the oil-paint crust. At first, plums were nipples full of gold milk; ripe and ready, my apples were firm and smooth, that heady fertiliser taste clutching their skin, sour and strong \u2014 as chemical as my make-up would taste to your tongue. Oranges promised a sharp, delicious bite and then juice gushing out like a cry in the night. When you started dating her I drew spat-out pips, the poisonous berries that grew around her hips. I daubed maggots in the core of each pink cherry, they squirmed out from the heart of every strawberry. In art class I was told I\u2019d lost all sense of perspective; ' my slit-split skinned pears were no longer objective. I stopped sleeping, began to sit up all night and paint my fetid black bananas, melons swollen and faint, and those peeled grapes, silver as your blind eyes. Are you allergic? Am I crawling with fruit fly? Without even tasting me, how is it fair to refuse? Did nobody tell you that once you\u2019ve inflicted a bruise, all the flesh around the hurt goes rotten brown? 46 \n￼Delay Businessmen are eating pre-packed sandwiches; they smile, as though aware I can\u2019t really afford the fare to London. My face is licked on the pane with a milky tongue. The anaemic countenance haunts rivers, office-blocks, mills - ghost of those who drowned internally, damning up dreams until canals of stagnant water carried their corpses out of those industrial towns. On one eye is a statue of Mary and child; on one eye is a supermarket; her tongue is weighted with a cathedral, a town hall; her mouth is the scar of a derelict road glittering with wasted streetlights. They never apologised for the delay; although inside she screamed like the brakes when they said You must disembark, miss, the line goes no further. My reflection moistens her lips, my lips, ready to bite down on some city, to tear it with our teeth, and swallow it entirely. \n￼Butterfly Collector The lake skin was the skin of a corpse, grazed by the wind, and the rank grasses caressed his shins, juices bleeding and soaking. He observed butterflies, those gaudy Icari, dumbly fluttering. Vowed to protect them from the drip-drip, the terrible dark plunge. The first that he caught was a Painted Lady, her tawny orange silks convulsing beneath his thick-fingered hand, spasms melting to calm. Later, he learnt to make a net from nylon curtain fabric, a hoop from clothes line. Used ammonia to poison softly as backhanded compliments. Recently he has been murdering the rainbow - he has a Red Admiral, an Orange Tip, a Green Hairstreak. Desperately, he aches for the Pale Clouded Yellow; dreams every night of its buttery wings beating against his face like eyelashes. It is still the painted lady he adores though. He didn\u2019t mean to break her antennae that time. Stuck them back on with a tear-drop of seccotine applied to the head. You wouldn\u2019t know there\u2019d been any damage. 48 \n￼Even at work, he finds himself imagining they are in some garden together. He is an Adonis Blue. The flutter of her wings mirrors his heart. Some days he plucks out the setting needle, gestures for her to fly, free, luxuriating in his own benevolence. She does not move. The caterpillars writhe amongst thistles, nettles, their flesh breeding dark hairs like pubis. Each time the needle plunges back in deeper. \n￼Poem for My Future Love I do not want a settle for second-best love. A mundane grow-to-love-him cosy little rut love. A pizza and a video, holding hands and making plans romance. I do not want to be able to look at him without crying. I do not want to be able to eat in his presence. I do not want to be fond of his little ways or to have fun whenever he\u2019s not there. I do not want our meeting to be a cute anecdote to tell our children, or to buy him aftershave for Christmas and receive French knickers in return. To go to the cinema with him and kiss mildly on the second to back row. I do not want to fall in love by halves. A dilute Milk Tray and two dozen red roses love. A maybe-this-is-it slow dancing and fancying romance. I want to fall in love so hard it bruises. I want to fall in love so hard it scars. I want to fall in love so hard it fractures, and cuts my knees and slices up my arms. I want to fall in love so badly I cough up blood. So madly I would confess to murder. t So terribly I would gouge out my eyes. So painfully I would gas myself. So utterly I would eat mud and bone. So crazily I would leap off ten-storey buildings in the night. I want a love that chokes me. Blinds me. Stabs me. Shoots me. Rips and burns me. Tears and wounds me. Heals me like new skin. \n￼It will be a passionate stupid vengeful breathless arrogant tender devouring painful fiery dirty gentle fumbling vicious beautiful glittering fatal pure love. It will be a complete and utter whole and total everything and all love. A love that is blind to colour. A love that is deaf to warnings. A love that does not feel the cold. A love that does not taste the blood. Not the kind of love you learn to take for granted, but the kind of love that makes you live in fear, and feel like you\u2019re only living when he\u2019s near. A love that will make breathing seem trivial. That will make time stop dead and the sun burn out. When he touches me my skin will sing. I will become electrically charged. I will tremble and ache when he speaks. I will smile stupidly at his name. I will start crying for no reason. I will love the smell of his limbs and the taste of his tears and the sweep of the curve of his back and the rhythm of his heart and the patterns of the pale blue veins on his wrists. I will only be able to sleep when he is holding me. I will talk to him even when he is not there. I will kiss him so hard my mouth will bleed. I will hold him so hard even surgeons will not be able to separate us, and for so long we will turn to ash and crumble. I will love him so much it will be illegal. Dangerous. I might explode. \n￼I do not want a settle for second-best love. A mundane grow-to-love-him cosy little rut love, a pizza and a video holding hands and making plans romance. I am waiting for the love that will renew me and send electric currents screaming through me. When I fall in love there will be thunder. Lightning. Fireworks. I am waiting for the love that I deserve. yr^ / \n￼Fresher It was to be a whole new chapter in the grim little pamphlet of his life. David became Dave, owner of Diesel jeans and obedient hair. His record collection was pared down brutally. He had anticipated girls with nipples big as the bottoms of beer-bottles. Their smiles white as vacant signs on toilet cubicles. There would be drunken sex on someone else\u2019s beanbags, Sneaking from curry-houses stinking of unpaid-for vindaloo, blowing each day\u2019s budget on lager and a twenty deck. He\u2019d make mates who could supply him with quality gear, scrape illicit powders to lines with his student union card. Yet here he is, in his bedroom at half past one, soberly wanking to distant techno beats, a stale taste in his mouth. His head swims with the short girl from geography who blanks him. And lying by the papery wall that his groans of reciprocated pleasure were to cause disturbance through, he can hear someone pissing. Nothing is new. It is all just the same but more impersonal. \n￼Hara-Kiri It is as small, complex and compact as a microchip. (God must be Japanese.) They will hook it out limb by limb. Tough veined trout pink flesh as raw as sushi. Nothing will remain of it but bloodspots on her bright white sheets like stubborn flags. If she let this grow it would cripple both of them. Hearts mutated by the fall-out. It would want to die for her. Kamikaze pilot. A noble death. It\u2019s karaoke! Everybody in the ward sing: \u2018Baby, where did our love go?\u2019 Career prospects and finances and practicality are squatting like sumos on her mind, and this rising sun holds no promise, for she will attack at herself at dawn and there will be no surrender. She will slit herself open. Watch it and her intestines slip out in the light of a Samurai sword. \n￼The Last Love Poem 1 This is the last love poem, there will be no more. I charge you, 0 daughters ofJerusalem, ifye find my beloved, that ye tell him, that I am sick o f love. For two years, a doll of you rattled round my scratched, spluttering heart chambers. Last night I tore it out, wiped off the gunk, the bloody slobbers, found the petty limbs shoddily made. Did I say your eyes were kind skies? They were painted sticky chlorine. Did I call your mouth perfection? It was just a splintered jut, moles nestling below it like rooks. I take everything back. 2 Love n. warm affection; sexual passion; wholehearted liking for something; beloved person. It was 2 a.m. on their first date. He took her to the derelict hospital, its gutted wing was rain drenched; incurable. And she always knew he would never be her suitor, her cavaliere, wooer, amoroso, his tongue ugly malt-sticky with Marlboro Lights, that thick Bolton accent pronouncing affaire de cceur, grande passion, made her laugh. SS \n￼But oh, the way he jerked from her touch, as though she\u2019d tried to slip ice-cubes down his shirt, hurt like she was chewed up, bitten, smitten, spoony, her gut spooned out. 3 The more you arch, the more access he has to your breasts and clitoris, and by being on top you have total control over how fast and how hard you want to go. I f ever any beauty I did see, which I desir'd, and got, t \u2019was but a dreame o f thee. The club flickers with the peach light of skin feigning arousal, the screens show thighs, ill- fitting uniforms, cheap off-white lace, bodies writhing in slicks of oil, like dying birds. She drinks the cocktails. Long slow screw. Multiple orgasm. Slippery nipple. The creamy green Shag. They are embarrassing to ask for, but she does, though her shy tongue would not dare articulate her real thirst. There is a scar on Beth\u2019sforehead, a small indentation made scratching at chicken-pox. I want to give her everything. Pamela Anderson fucks on a motorbike. 4 Here love his golden shafts employs, here lights his constant lamp and waves his purple wings, Did I say how nice your mouth was? Did I say? There\u2019s something wrong, isn\u2019t there? Tell me what\u2019s wrong. \n￼These, lulled by nightingales, embracing slept, And on their naked limbs theflowery roofshowered roses. There\u2019s something wrong. I\u2019m paranoid, forgive me. Do you still love her? Tell me. There\u2019s something wrong. Know to know no more. 5 Love was invented by the church to encourage monogamy and reduce illegitimate births. Love was invented by the capitalists to ensure a system of patrilineal inheritance. Are you listening? It is a fake, whatever the hell you think you\u2019re feeling. It is socialisation, and Wonderbra adverts, and biological practicality, and the ruling elite. In most countries romance doesn\u2019t even exist. It\u2019s a big western lie. IT IS IN YOUR FUCKING HEAD. Some people say they are in love every week, some never say it, some say it once (but afterwards, finding red-eyed photographs or weeping over sliced onions, feel nothing but impotence), some feminists feel in love is impossible in our oppressive society, some girls buy magazines for the front-page promises: how to catch your man, twenty ways to make him love you, / some people will not change for love, some cannot, some look in the mirror and do not recognise their own breasts, or necks, kissed to cream and purring. Baby\u2019s good to me, you know, she\u2019s happy as can be, you know, she said so. Ironic, how the moon looks like a contraceptive pill. How love drenches the loved, whilst the loveless suck at the stems of roses, hoping for moisture, slicing up their mouths on the barbed wire stems. S7 \n￼Yes. Will I ever be happy? 6 Certain words belong in love poems: milk, sweat, swallow, cinnamon, jasmine, hummingbird, indigo, nectarine, salt, humid, cut. They mean nothing, but he likes to watch her mouth shape the sounds: scar, molasses, beloved person. 7 ... And to win tonight\u2019s big prize of eternal misery, you simply have to complete the sentence: Love is.. a) When you cannot see any flaws, or b) When you see all the flaws, and love each utterly. Answer it incorrectly, and you\u2019re suffering for NOTHING, you stupid bitch! Lucy loves Chris loves Sarah loves Karen loves John loves Anna. This worm eats heart-flesh, tongue-flesh, thigh-flesh. It is in the drinking water, the bedclothes, the loo-roll. WAKE UP! IT WILL EAT YOU ALIVE! RUN! HIDE! Anna loves Steve loves Kate loves M att loves Tom loves Louise. \n￼This worm eats eye-jelly, ear-drums, crotch-meat. It is in your Beatles albums, your TV, your stockings. DON\u2019T LOOK! IT WILL LEAVE YOU FOR BLIND! RUN! HIDE! Lovelorn adj. forsaken by or pining for a lover. Comfort me ivith apples: for I am sick of love. 8 In 1995, approximately 40 percent of marriages were found to end in divorce. Her love altered where it alteration found, so was not love, merely infatuation, a crush. But oh my God she was crushed utterly, and who can claim to know how love is measured? She cried into the bathroom carpet all Christmas Day for that man, and did not count the tears, but the wool was sodden. Her face took the texture of the weave. (Oh, but he will suffer, she tells herself. One day he will wake to find that loss has kidnapped him, and he is gagged and bound in a dark, rat-ridden cellar. One day he will realise the scale of her worth and, awestruck, hack off those fingers which allowed her to slip through.) To know know know him is to love love love him and I do. 59 \n￼9 By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not. In your room, with its stained duvet, your Che Guevara poster, the guitar which clings jealously to your fingerprints, do you dream about me ever, do you wake up touching yourself, the breeze flickering against your skin like my eyelashes, seeing ghosts of my hair, my hip bones bruising your eyelids? Last night, every night, I dream of you. I dreamt I saw you across the still lake, and screamed at you for giving me this burden, this melancholy, this rotting smell. You looked up, your face a torn petal against the ache of the dark forest, and we two stood staring at each-other, my arms laden with feathers, flesh, and the stones which weighted me, a paper doll, to your awful silence. 10 Ev 'ry time we say goodbye, I cry a little. How the world was made, the afterlife, infinity, the soul, all the great questions mean nothing, nothing at all, when she is close and can almost lick the raw, bitten down skin where he tore the fingernail off with his teeth. Whitethroat, skylark, goldfinch, they dip and soar, quite loveless, yet still alive. How can they not sink beneath the weight of no breath on skin, no tongue, no I love you, ever? \n￼11 Did my heart love till now? Forswear it sight! So that is it? Just friends? I cannot bear it. For I ne 'er saw true beauty till this night. Can\u2019t you see what you are doing? You will destroy me. Thus from my lips by thine my sin is purged. Talk to me. Say something. You will destroy me. Give me my sin again. Shantih, shantih. Oh, but his mouth is the most beautiful thing. 12 This was to be the last love poem, but I love him, and if I say it enough he might love me. I will write other love poems - It is fucking degrading. Stars I have named after him grind into my skin like crushed glass. 6; \n￼4a a \\y\\ ","docTitle":"","docDate":"2014-07-01 08:53:56.486"},"meta":{"contentType":"text/raw","emVer":"7.1.1103.5","langIdVer":"DefaultLangId","processingVer":"CalaisJob01","submissionDate":"2014-07-01 08:53:34.895","submitterCode":"57b17a53-6e34-87b0-20ff-a419896f49c9","signature":"digestalg-1|WmdZ8JJTZgRYHyvG4Gu23tPUn6g=|kFZUVChDeRSNkww2kr1HG3TkcNmA0oLqg9iQzqPpjQTqDeRTYYqeDQ==","language":"English"}},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/366d2acf-8b0b-321f-9fb0-28642ec7fce4/cat/1":{"_typeGroup":"topics","category":"http://d.opencalais.com/cat/Calais/HumanInterest","classifierName":"Calais","categoryName":"Human Interest","score":0.51},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/366d2acf-8b0b-321f-9fb0-28642ec7fce4/Message/1":{"_typeGroup":"messages","messagetype":"warning","messagecode":201,"text":"Document-level timeout reached in module mediaextensions_for_unifiedim, concept PersonOrPersonDetailsOr1stPronoun"},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/366d2acf-8b0b-321f-9fb0-28642ec7fce4/lid/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http://d.opencalais.com/lid/DefaultLangId/English"},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/e911da6b-56e4-3544-9357-5d79d01c1538":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"Position","name":"author","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/Position","instances":[{"detection":"[ Designs and Patents Act 1988 to be identified as ]the author[ of this work.
