Amodo sic agere, vivere tam libere, talem vitam ducere viri vetat etas, perimit et eximit leges assuetas. Etas ilia monuit, docuit, consuluit, sic et etas annuit: 'Nichil est exclusum Omnia cum venia contulit ad usum. Volo resipiscere, linquere, corrigere quod commisi temere; deinceps intendam seriis, pro vitiis virtutes rependam. 70 \n￼A new leaf While my youth was fresh and green my routine was quite serene: all was pleasure; 1 was keen on the scent of action, quick to chase and then embrace carnal satisfaction. Now my age begins to tell: raising hell 's all very well, but the middle years compel sober introspection; then a man will try to plan changes of direction. Youth advised me to be free \u2014 actively encouraged me; when I ventured on a spree there was no restriction: 'Go ahead,' my conscience said, with its benediction. Now it's time for penitence, continence and abstinence; now I want to learn some sense; henceforth I'll be graver: I'll go straight, and cultivate ways to Heaven's favour.
