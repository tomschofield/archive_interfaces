It takes up warmth and retains it briefly thus seeming to give. Its innocent integument covers a wiry heart. It plays with fugitive light catching whatever it can to dispose as its own; starlight on frost, you could say, or sun on a railway line, would not outstare it. It has its dangers^ then^, for you who wear it; such images might be, when all is said, too near whatever truth vibrates under those invisible follicles. wic^e/vse- j j j } 41 \n￼A Photograph of Your Friends One of your friends is in silver, the other in black: an obvious pair, slumped on a padded settle; their legs shine without fuss, their emptied glasses teeter, they arc contemptuous of us. Silver\u2019s intent on the lens, Black is intent on her. Silver smiles firmly as if the lens is her bedroom mirror and her teeth secret omens. Black^s lunging to splutter a kiss on the turning jaw and test her palm along a silver thigh. For her the camera, like everything outside herself, is a minor flaw in the world, a mild aberration. There the disco sound encloses and invades with its big feel. Your friends, you claim, are vibrant, raw, you have got to say, real; this fixes one of their phases. Their eyes are flat and unexcitable. They\u2019re much like you, you say, hoping I\u2019ll think you mistaken; or partly so, for a part o f you wants to be partly taken as living inside your own law, sublimely silver, or black and stricken. 42 ( Ckc^e^c & 1 f » ","docTitle":"","docDate":"2014-07-01 09:46:54.496"},"meta":{"contentType":"text/raw","emVer":"7.1.1103.5","langIdVer":"DefaultLangId","processingVer":"CalaisJob01","submissionDate":"2014-07-01 09:46:54.216","submitterCode":"57b17a53-6e34-87b0-20ff-a419896f49c9","signature":"digestalg-1|zX6WmlkCrnMafbeVYPFm/SK7Sbc=|fRSsmpf47YbXhDzSg7pkH6xEWnovE6ImC3BZ+mRnesejJE/Xt4ah6Q==","language":"English"}},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/8e0df629-2ba0-30ea-ab2e-7e8c35862906/lid/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http://d.opencalais.com/lid/DefaultLangId/English"},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/f0de9606-a91f-3290-8e58-29c0b3c3aeab":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"IndustryTerm","name":"metal","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/IndustryTerm","instances":[{"detection":"[ ￼Bracelet That touching ]metal[ deceives; its cool smooth skin polishes skin and]","prefix":" ￼Bracelet That touching ","exact":"metal","suffix":" deceives; its cool smooth skin polishes skin and","offset":25,"length":5}],"relevance":0.597}}
