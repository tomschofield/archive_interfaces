I\u2019ve often wished I could tell you, Bill - I\u2019ve managed it since 1982! But this is not so much a living as a vocation; I really did begin this thing believing I - we - could help to make this world a hap  pier and more equal place, and the fact that Newspeak is now real  ity, everything that my parents\u2019 generation fought for is being des  troyed and the atmosphere in this country is getting more squalid, selfish and unpleasant by the minute just makes me angrier and more determined not to throw in the towel! For all those on the Left throughout the world whose eyes are dulled and spirit shat  tered by years of defeat I say: do not go gently!

Page 2 delete exclamation marks after '1982', 'throw in the towel' and 'do not go gently.'(Ideological advisor says overstated. I see her point.) Page 3 should have Eric Bloodaxe above your logo. He's my mate. Page 4: slight query about the legal notice. I often get requests for work to be included in fanzines and other non-profit publications. That\u2019s not a problem for you, is it? Otherwise fine. CUe^^e , Page 5. Dedication: For Joy Page 6. (Neil, you sarky bastard, you did it deliberately! Don't shoot until you can see the whites of their eggs!)
