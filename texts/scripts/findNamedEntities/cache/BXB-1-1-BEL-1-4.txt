Martin Bell\u2019s life can be seen all too easily as a cautionary tale of the price the poet pays for inspiration. Indeed, it is already being represented this way in some quarters. It is no secret that his later years were blighted by addiction to alcohol, and complicated by depression, lack of recognition, shortage of money and touches of paranoia. It is quite easy, of course, to accept this pattern and still go on to praise Bell as a poet - indeed, if one wants to achieve the full romantic apotheosis, the life\u2019s agony is a necessary pre-condition of the ultimate vindication. That Bell deserves wholehearted vindi  cation for a life almost religiously devoted to poetry is beyond doubt, yet such an approach to him and to his verse is both a simplification and a misrepresentation. All who knew him well will assert that he remained at all times, to use an appellation which Auden was fond of, \u2018no wet-4*g.\u2019. He was a man of great charm, enormous erudition and, despite his devotion to serious literature, someone who observed the world around him with extra-journalistic sharpness and wit. The hermetic poet in him shared a sensibility with the worldly moralist and social critic. He was the true inheritor of the Auden mantle (his only rival the slighdy older Gavin Ewart), and, even during his later concen  tration on twentieth-century French poetry, he kept faith with the thirties\u2019 creed of poetry as an agent of moral healing, a tracking down of the spoor of history as it is imprinted on our world. He had a highly developed sense of the poet as magus, refiner of the tribal language and high priest of psychic understanding. Sometimes it seemed paradoxical, in his later years, to find him, broke and slightly bewildered, speaking of the poet\u2019s power and pride which made him a dangerous adversary and forceful catalyst. Music andJungian con  cepts were the only orders which came near to sharing the supremacy ofpoetry in his imagination once his disillusion with the Communist Party took him out of active politics. In one of his best poems, \u2018Reasons for Refusal\u2019, Bell invokes his friend Roger Frampton, \u2018desert-killed in \u201940\u2019, as \u2018a pattern of accomplishments...joiij^d the Party first, and left it first\u2019. These words can be used of Bell himself if the accomplishments be taken further to include infallible taste in literature and moral generosity. Nor did he ever desert the idealism which possessed so many ofthe finer spirits of his generation: he was always a man of the Left, even if he loved to add a Gidean 'helas' after claiming to be so. He was prescient of the dreadful blight of right-wing reaction in which we find ourselves today, recording as early as 1961 the way things were \n￼going in an England bored with the egalitarianism and libertarianism of the post-war Labour governments We didn\u2019t want to say the way things went Pissed on the hopes we entertained, Na'ive, of course, but vivid and still pissedon - (Christ, boy, they\u2019re reading The Times now!) &\\d >arr> ao3\"~i i~v What he would have made of Thatcher\u2019s Britain I cannot imagine. My feelings vary between relief that he is out of it and regret that the philippics it would have spurred him to will never be written. We have many pre-echoes, however, in his poetry of twenty years earlier - \u2018But the terrifying thing/ Is houses/ A stake in the country Something to hand down.... Dismal boxes voting tory.\u2019 Martin Bell was bom in Southampton in 1918 and lived there until he was twenty-one. His father worked for the Southern Rail  way, and Bell always described his parents as lower middle-class. Certainly, there was not much money about during his childhood and manhood, and this prevented his profiting from his education to enable him to set out on a literary career - at least until he was in his thirties. The war, of course, was a further obstruction to his progress. But it was not poverty which rankled with him so consis  tently, but the fearful gentility which went with it. Poem after poem testifies to the warping influence of lower middle-class respectabil  ity, most clearly felt in people\u2019s sexual lives. Only D.J. Enright, in The Terrible Shears (\u2018Whatever sex was, it was another enemy\u2019) has covered this ground as effectively: the novelist\u2019s world of keeping up appearances, sexual timidity and class embarrassment has never much appealed to poets, and only Bell and Enright have made it eloquent as verse.^s, <TfisTelationship with his mother was close and neurasthenic, as late memoirs, letters and a dream-diary indicate. One of his most sardonic poems is called \u2018Ode to Psychoanalysis\u2019 and it indicates clearly that this expensive therapy could not lift the weight of child  hood neurosis from his mind. But Bell was always able to place them in a larger context where the personal becomes the general. His perfect command of rhetoric never deserted him. The \u2018Ode to Psychoanalysis\u2019 ends with him \u2018suffering Hell because I\u2019m al overdrawn/Atthebankwhosemanagerhovers/Clackingrevengeful shears/^Hey there! Nobfttatidy!/ That\u2019s my flaming sword...\u2019The Blake reference is not just a neat summing up, it ties in with all the invocations to penis, bowels and negative transference, and reminds No us that Freudianism is based in prophetic religion as strongly as in medical science. \n￼Democracy (from Rimbaud) The colours on parade, dipping past the filthy bricks ofthis garrison town. Boots, newly issued, stutter on the cobbles; but we can keep step. We\u2019ll be posted overseas, to the big Base Depots.

We\u2019ll make the black bastards work: leader-writers will talk about the Commonwealth. Anywhere, to get away from home. Glad to be back in the army, we\u2019ll use our loaves, all right.

By- The- Right- Quick- MARCH 71 \n￼Instruction for my Godson (for William Redgrave) God help me, I\u2019m supposed to see you\u2019re told All about God the Father. So my beard mutters: There are always two fathers, one Good and one Bad. You can\u2019t miss the Bad One, he\u2019s always around, Particularly first thing in the morning, Scruffy and screaming for a razor-blade, Wondering who to eat up for his breakfast - He won\u2019t eat you however much he shouts. I\u2019m not trying to sell you bad old Nob^daddy - Learn to shrug off his sessions on his throne Farting thunderbolts and belching clouds. The Good One has a different way with clouds; he watches. He knows fifty-seven ways at least of looking at them, He addresses them politely, and his looking Can hold them still in the sky. 72 / \n￼I didn\u2019t get very far, acting it out With Doctor Hackenbush. I developed, he said, \u2018A massive negative transference,\u2019 So the analysis was cut off After I hadn\u2019t paid him For over two months - He took two-fifths of my wages. (His name wasn\u2019t Hackenbush anyway). I still wanted to kill Stalin After that. But I felt I\u2019d let Freud down. The cook would not run the State, And the State wouldn\u2019t wither away, And psycho-analysis Was very expensive indeed: Postpone, for the time being, The New Jerusalem. IV So here I am, in the middle of several paths, More or less where I\u2019ve always been Having survived war and intensive masturbation Getting away with murder, maybe But suffering Hell because I\u2019m always overdrawn At the bank whose manager hovers Clacking revengeful shears.
