Her poised, ironic poems are tense and tightly controlled as well as shrewdly laconic, and often chilling as she unmasks the deceptions of love or unravels family lives. Disarmingly conversational in style, they are remarkable for their psychological insight and their unsentimental, mischievously casual view of personal relationships. Born in New Zealand, she has explored questions of identity and rootedness throughout her work, both in relation to her personal allegiances to her native and adopted countries as well as her family history, whose long-dead characters she brings to life. She has also written movingly of birth, death and bereavement, and has tackled political issues with honest indignation and caustic wit. This first Collected edition of her poetry replaces her Selected Poems, with the addition of work from her later Oxford collections The Incident Book, Time-Zones and Looking Back. All her most celebrated poems are here, from the highly entertaining \u2018Against Coupling\u2019, \u2018Smokers For Celibacy\u2019 and T h e Prize-W inning Poem\u2019 to modern classics such as T h e Ex-Queen Amongst the Astronomers\u2019 and Things\u2019 - as well as the notorious one about kissing John Prescott... \u2018Adcock has a deceptively laid-back tone, through which the sharper edge of her talent is encountered like a razor blade in a peach\u2019- carol ann duffy, Guardian \u2018Adcock\u2019s reputation has been founded on her spare, conversational poems, in which the style is deceptively simple, apparently translucent...a voice which teases both readerandsubject\u2019- joshapcott,TLS \u2018Most of Fleur Adcock\u2019s best poems have something to do with bed: she writes well about sex, very well about illness, and very well indeed about dream ing...Her imagination thrives on what threatens her peace of mind, and only when she is unguarded can these threats have their full creative effect...Throughout her writing life, she has made a fine art from holding on to principles of orderliness and good clear sense; but she has made an even finer one from loosening her grip on them \u2019 - ANDREW MOTION, TLS 51Q0DAX6 BQDK5 \n￼Fleur Adcock P O E M S 1960-2000 POETRY BOOK SOCIETY SPECIAL COMMENDATION FLEUR ADCOCK POEMS 1960-2000 B150DAX6 ","docTitle":"","docDate":"2014-07-01 08:43:17.958"},"meta":{"contentType":"text/raw","emVer":"7.1.1103.5","langIdVer":"DefaultLangId","processingVer":"CalaisJob01","submissionDate":"2014-07-01 08:43:17.209","submitterCode":"57b17a53-6e34-87b0-20ff-a419896f49c9","signature":"digestalg-1|6XiALC+lcVLZ4q9us2UxEko1J/k=|j+P2+f3D8yAQUByoqU+E2XVD0vYjKvw8ND4TkU762g744firmCM1GA==","language":"English"}},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/85b83ed2-74b4-302e-9448-39ae1a386715/lid/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http://d.opencalais.com/lid/DefaultLangId/English"},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/4d7d3ba5-7ff5-36ae-99bf-29f0b28c0ef6":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"Facility","name":"NATIONAL GALLERY","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/Facility","instances":[{"detection":"[A Lady with a Squirrel and a Starling © ]NATIONAL GALLERY[, LONDON NEIL ASTLEY £ 10.95 9 78I852 245306]","prefix":"A Lady with a Squirrel and a Starling © ","exact":"NATIONAL GALLERY","suffix":", LONDON NEIL ASTLEY £ 10.95 9 78I852 245306","offset":648,"length":16}],"relevance":0.269},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/e911da6b-56e4-3544-9357-5d79d01c1538":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"Position","name":"AUTHOR","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/Position","instances":[{"detection":"[was given an OBE in 1996.
