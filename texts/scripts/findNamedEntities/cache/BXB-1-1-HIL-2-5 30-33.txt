Plans, and plans about plans, and sex, was his idea of happiness. He wore a floppy hat. She felt so lonely! Another thing, she couldn\u2019t spell. Laborinth. Itiniry. Elann. She cooked him cockles in a thick orange sauce, and bought him a suitcase - \u2018for the Great Man\u2019. They sat on a rocky mountain dressed in leather. Sardines and beer. Parois vertigineuses. Their children were his books. She understood that. 0 Significado De Significado, lecture notes. \u2018The blissfully well-run nursing-home\u2019 is now public knowledge - her little lump, like longing, prized from her oesophagus; her crawling from the hut on her knees. A tortoise-shell comb, embroidery, The Crack. A lovely moth. \u2018The nurse is a crashing bore\u2019 ...poking about among her mysteries.

Please come home. Lust has turned her hidden milk to bone. Peach-blossoms stiffen, goat-thick orchards sink, eyed beetles wink and push like hounds against her skin; peach-girl, don\u2019t go. Shaky, untouchable, defiled by desire, she casts around for somewhere soft to lie. Come here. The knee-deep fruit play Queenie with her loving soul, stripped clean and tranquil by the coloured mouths of peaches soft as eiderdowns. They whisper Queenio. I said Come here. 31 \n￼Hill Trembling 25-58 3/2/94 1:01 pm RajP 32 Peggy He loved the sunlight \u2014 this was in New Mexico - he loved the sunlight, and he used to go for long walks with the llama, Peggy; and when his mother died, one night in June, he brought the llama with him to the funeral: standing like a queen in the mist, batting herjjig'eye-lashes like cream. His mother died to get away from them! She suffered terribly. He used to be a tailor like his father - pricking his pot-belly with the pins and sucking the red-currants that he made.^/ His mother was a gold statuette.^ He wanted so much love, that was the trouble, yet, if you tried to smile, he looked away. The llama called him Chocolate Eyes. She said, Don\u2019t cry. She was the only thing he wanted in the end. f 32 -e- \n￼Hill Trembling 25-58 3/2/94 1:01 pm Rage 33 Natural Wonders I The lovely boy washes himself all over in a ski-hut. His mother sends a new suit every year. \u2018He only cares about his mathematics.\u2019 II He\u2019s tired. He hates the snow. He can\u2019t stop masturbating. Each little death, each floating point cries Heaven, where are you now? Ill The handsome mountain-dwelling monk lies dead. Something is wrong with the electric fan. His secret love-affair exceeds his wildest dreams, while here on earth the other monks are lapsing.
