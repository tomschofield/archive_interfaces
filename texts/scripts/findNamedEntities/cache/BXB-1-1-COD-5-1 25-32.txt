Io, no, he*s with us at Butlin's still. He\u2019s off the drink, says Pat. WS© r I never did. nince when? Thirteen days. He's lasting well. He's serious. I'm bad, says Took, my guts is worse and worse. But you nersevere, you force it down. Was it religion? the Marquis asks. .o, no, I say, though i believe that's entering into it somewhat now. Hor was it a woman's intervention, which is very often the case, many a man, thousands pcrhapsT well, one or two- have been pulled back from the abyss in the nick of time by the weak hand of a woman, so I beiieve. no, it was bile, he told me, the green stuff, every morning. Aye, says Took, that's it. when you get the bile that reg  ular it's time to stop. Puts the wind up you. And then the doc: carry on as you are, old chap, and we'll be rid of you before the next Big Meeting. Might be too late already, I expect your liver's gone. Telled me the same, says Took, he's v/ashed his hands of me. It's your funeral, old chap, don't come blaming me. Well that's right, says the 'Widow, it's a free country. A quack'll never promise anything, says Pat, they've got to cover themselves. Walter nods: you drop dead on Christmas Day when he guaranteed you'd see the New Year in and he's got a court case on his hands, h-e-s-rrM; Hardly seems worth it then, says Patp no guarantee. That's it, says Took, not worth the risk. And he'll always have that nose,^they never' lose the nose. I had an uncle joined the Rechabites after a nasty shock he met with underground. Drank nothing but water for the rest of his life, but he never lost the nose, fiery, riddled with little veins, rooted bulbous in a hearty face. T.T. and a drinker's nose, burning like a slag heap for years after the pit's worked out. He'll never look a sober man. Hardly seems worth it then, he'll get no cr;dit from the general public. I ex>ect we'd all start airesh, says the Marquis, if the Almighty would wipe the slate clean first. Albert's feeling the pains, I say, the ones in his liver the doctor told him to look out for. Makes you wonder whether it's worth it. He says he's seeing things: his dead mother, for a start, with tears in her eyes. I knew a 2S' \n￼<■ man in London stopped, says Pat. He was dead before the week was out. Utter collapse, I suppose, and the blue devils gathering .round his bed. The Widow fills our glass  es. Best to keep on, says Took, I'm generally alright by opening time. Anyway, missus, that's where Albert is, since you were so kind as to enquire. He'll be a better man for it, says Mrs Clack, if he sees it through, that is. There's one person at least who doesn't think it's too late to make amends, uive him ray good wishes, will you, gentlemen. I'll be pleased to serve him a tonic water whenever he likes. I was afraid he had been pressed. Some fellers have, you know, and not such youngsters either, even as they lay in drink, and God knows where by now. 1 made Joe put the Union Jack out over the door, thought it might keep the Redcaps away. Hasn't been up since the last coronation but one, and he had some trouble with it. I can see he did, missus. Wants to be higher, Joe, droops a bit at present, you'll not mind ray saying so. Silence. A circulation of the onions. At the approach of a train the glasses behind the pensive Widow begin to shiver. Is that singing 1 hear? the Marquis asks. Aye, says the Widow, dabbing her eyes- lustrous as chandeliers- you'll hear their voices when the wind's right, lads from the north being transported. Ghost Riders in the Sky, I call 'em. You remember that old song? We do, missus, by Doris Day, I believe, and a very good song it was. The singing passes, almost over  head, so it seems, the wheels of the wagons clanking like skeletons in chains. I rub my bumps. Reminds me of my own departures, I say, accepting a roll  up from Patrick on my right. There's nothing quite like un  iformed lads in cattle-trucks for bringing out the best in the human race, especially- with a bow towards our land  lady- in its female parts. Were you ever pressed, Mr Horn? the Marquis asks, ho, I reply, I didn't wait for that, I went of my own accord once I was persuaded that the cause was just. My bum, says rook, smacking his lips in a manner inimitable, my hairless bum he did. A civil tongue, Mr Took, if you don't mind, says the Widow, or we shall see less of you than we do of Albert, and for a different reason. -Because you will be barred. You will be refused admission to these premises, off-sales also will be denied you, and 2.6 \n￼any man attempting to circumvent that ruling and make a purchase on your behalf, he will be barred also, and for twice your term. My judgment is final, no use you coining knocking at the side door after hours or slip  ping me apologies t 'rough the letter-box. A man barred is barred and any man sneaking up for him will also be barred, because to make any submission on a barred man's behalf would be to impugn my judgment. Those still in wouj.d be wise, on the whole, not even to mention the barred man's name; for 1 will not have him, even in his name, in the presence of the good things I have barred him from. Bear in mind what it is you stand to lose, for so long as I decide- it might be a week, a fortnight, a month, a year, and in one or two cases (pity the man)wive f-adrks_in.tn it has been sine die- for so long as I decide- and you v/ill have no means of knowing how long that is, but word will come to you when you have served your time- for so long then, until you hear the word (and mercy on you if you never do; you will not see me against this background of sparkling glasses and fairylights, my diamond ear-rings, given me by Dicky, my diamante hair-do, my brilliant eyes, my breasts (their hapny valley),under lurex pink, dozing warmly on the bar, all these things you will be missing out there in the cold or as you visit, disconsolate, other houses. For nowhere is like here, neither in the person of its pro  prietress, that goes without saying, nor in its hospit  able little extras, those cubes of cheese, those frisky little silverskins, its open hearth cheerfully blazing in most weathers, its generosity over last orders. You will miss the company of which you were a part, those men who never voluntarily go anywhere else and to whose talk you have, evening after evening, for amusement and for profit, attended and according to your gifts contributed. Where else will you meet such variety of men? ;mt at the Buffalo, not at the Bridge, at the Brewers certainly not and at trie Fighting Cocks, don't make me laugh. Aman with the manners of the Marquis here or the loquacity of Mr Horn? 1 doubt it, I very much doubt it. So be mindful ofwhat you run the risk of forfeiting. Keep a civil tongue andabide by all the other laws, largely unwritten, of this house from which 1 myself, were I to be barred, which is not possible, could 2-7 \n￼not bear to be absent for more than an afternoon. Carry on, Mr Horn. It was late March, if 1 remember rightly, or early April, when at last I made up my mind. For months, reading the broadsheets and the bulletins, I had been weighing the rights and wrongs of the matter. Though I loved my country- no man more- I wanted to be persuaded, before I enlisted, of the justice of her cause. What swayed me in the end was a speech by the late King's nanny circulating that year as an Easter card. In it the good woman recalled certain of her royal charge's most endearing baby ways, and declared roundly that she would have torn him from her dugs and fed his sweet body to the crows had she not been sure that, come the hour, he would stand as firm as his father before him had. Quite why this tipped the balance I am at a loss to ex  plain; but it did. I was employed at the time as a skill  ed tatie and turnip man on a farm beyond Tow Law; and hav  ing made many friends there I knew I should be missed. Accordingly, I told no-one of my decision but rose v«*=kl before first light and rook myself off as I had come, like a thief in the night. Imagine the cold road and the flaming starry heavens, and under those stars and looting it along that road a young man with everything in life to lose. Stars and road: no problem, nut the young man with everything to lose is a tall order. Think first of having anything to lose, and work from that. Among my new-found friends on and around the farm was one, as you would ex  pect, of the female sex, a girl such as the region had never seen before and doubtless has not since, a thrrrTg blown in from Paradise, very wild in the soul and innoc  ent. And I left her too when Britannia wooed and won me. Well that was very sad, I'm sure, says the Widow. Duty is duty, Mrs Clack, the Marquis observes, the interference of national obligation into a man's private life can be very upsetting, I believe. Not that she wouldn't be better off with somebody else, says the Widow. Still, it's very sad. I think of the woman's feelings in these matters, of course, being one myself. Naturally you do, Mrs Clack. I'd have stayed put, says Pat. Who knew you were out t'iere? Nobody, I'll bet. Y o u might have bided there quietly till it was all over, if you'd kept your head down. Well that's ie \n￼also true, says the marquis, but you can't fight wars with  out soldiers, old chap. Somebody has to turn up on the day. Well it won't be me, says Pat. So what happened next, Mr Horn? Joe asks from behind the bar, leaning forward with his horsey teeth encouragingly. Hold your noise, Joe, says the severe Widow. Mr Horn will move on when he's<'*.*und to without you butting in. At daybreak, I continue, I stood alone and shivering^thigh- deep, chest-deop,in an infinite mist. The valleys were in- lindated and the crowning hilltops rolled like dolphins. God blinked and beamed and skylarks climbed their scales. My shaggy eyebrows dripped. Where I had come from with all its dreaming girls and boys lay still bathing in the shall  ows of a warm sleep; but looking east I saw the first out  riding furnaces already red and gasping, stack fingers raised and the leaden smoke sagging out to sea. On that morning summit, my girl asleep behind me innocent of her harm, I was all enflamed with love and sacrifice, all burn  ing v/ith fate* I stood above everyone on the rungs of my decision, I could give and take as I enooe, and so, as my girl rose and looked at herself in the mirror and saw her face for the first time as the face of a girl betrayed, I went down into the city and by late maorning had put myself under the big thumb of a sergeant major. That very night, Mrs Clack, obscure among thousands, I clanked in a cattle truck over your viaduct south, feeling a cold musket spout upright against my midriff. To think I never knew, the Widow sighs. You and your mus  ket travelling through the sky and me down here never know  ing. Are we all clear in our own minds, Walter asks, what war this gentleman is hereby referring to? Are we quite certain that this lady could have known of this particul  ar private's passing in the night? What age, respectively, were the parties concerned of? Walter, I say, there's no doubt in my mind, whatever there may be in yours, thet at the time above referred to our good Mrs Clack here lay in bed in her white nightdress, a young and innocr^gt girl, and heard, in her dreams at least, the pretty glasses tinkling down below in rather's bar, and received thus a tremor, an intimation as it were, of first love, and that was me, pass  ing overhead to serve my King or Queen, and vibrations- ad- 2-1 \n￼mittedly of a kind your literal mind would have trouble grasping the exact nature of- travelled from my heart into hers and from hers back again into mine. Silence. Hot flushes course to and fro all over Mrs Clack. Permission to speak, missus. It is Took, raising a pink fist. The magisterial Widow nods. You know the rules. Ko >e to hang himself? His speech organs begin to work with a terrific energy, his lips smack ana munch wetly, flay back in sudden spasms from off his gums or pout forward to form a round hole through which pushes, at the culmination of his labour, his purple tongue. Still we hear nothing but a wet blurting. His face pink- ens; his brows meanwhile are rising and falling with such vehemence that a flat cap set^an angle on his en  tirely round head lifts and drops back again like the lid on a boiling saucepan, nis piggy eyes? They dart sharp little glances my way. His ears, tumescent, tv/itch. But words- words fail him, and whether the cause of the impediment is forward in the mouth (lips, tongue and gums writhing in morxal combat rather than consorting harmoniously in the silver dance of speech;, or aft, in some lobe or nest of cells, the spring, in a healthy man, of winged utterance but in xook ^the drink, no doubt, or blows to the casing of the place sustained in drink) a can of worms, who knows? A post-mortem would find out, a section through his globe, but Medical Sci  ence will have to v/ait for that, though Took himself would agree to it now if the price were right. Mrs Clack, i say, our friend's wish to speaic- generous  ly given the go-ahead by your good self- is unfortunately not matched by the requisite ability. He ap ears to be suffering a blockage of sorts, and I am afraid that if he strains much longer he may rupture some vital organ. How  ever, it would be unjust, and wholly uncharacteristic of this house, if a man with something to say were to go un  heard merely for want of the ability to say it. 1 propose therefore to discharge Hr Took's passion for him, by speak  ing on his behalf. That he has a load on his mind is plain to see. rhirik of me then .as a midwife or, if you prefer, as a nightsoil man. The expletive for which you rightly \n￼reprimanded him some minutes ago is sufficient indication that his speech, had he been able to deliver it, would have taken the form of a contradiction of my account- rather as follows, I suspect. j.did no sue)] thing, whether the cause was just or not was a matter of the completest indifference to me; indeed, when I enlisted I load not the least idea what the issues were, nor did I ever trouble to enquire. The girl I left behind me was in the family way, by me at that. Her name was Mabel Smurthwaite, and I joined up double quick when her father, a butcher, came after me with a cleaver. Took and I were in the Cock o' the North when a fellow we called Little Snotty tipped me off. The bab- by that poor girl brought into the world rose to be man  ageress of a novelties factory in Gateshead, without the least encouragement, pecuniary or moral, from her mis  creant father. That's it in a nutshell. Mr 'Took himself would doubtless have added a few embellishments, as for exainDle that this little episode was neither the first of e its kind nor that last; that I have been known to visit both the wronged ladies, mother and daughter, in the hope of accommodation or a hand-out; that in neither household have 1 ever been welcomed, except once, in the mother's, when I had the nerve to arrive on the anniversary of the conception of the daughter, in drink, emaciated, and carry  ing a single yellow rose. There may be more- it depends how far the alcoholic corrosion of his powers of memory or invention has advanced- or it may be that already I have been over-generous. Still, says the Widow, you passed over the viaduct in the dead of night. Nobody's denying that. I suspect a lot of men use the Armed Forces as a bolt-hole, says the Marquis. That's especially true of the French Foreign Legion, 1 believe. They ask no questions, Patrick says. The same might be said of the Catholic Church, says the Marquis, admission into a monastic order, I mean. Aye, Patrick continues, all they want is your oath of allegiance signed in blood. Happy, Took? He grins. I put the record straight. That is, to prevent you from choking or exploding in the pres  ence of a lady I made a public showing of a warty self. 3/ \n￼But how about this instead? It's true I desert Miss Sraurthwaite, and she is with child, my motive however is not a base wish to evade responsibilities but a putting of my King or Queen and country first. Or this: I leave a girl on a farm to the vest of Tow Law, I leave her virgo intacta, I leave in the night because a the apple orchard at twilight on the pre  vious evening she has admitted her love for me and has asserted that, come the morning, she will give her betroth  ed, a hardworking labourer whose nrospects are good, the push and be mine thereafter', body and soul, with or without a promise of marriage. The essence is you leave. You leave, you cut and run, you let her go to bed thinking to see you when she wakes, and in the night, once you are certain that the whole hospitable place is sleeping, you pick up your boots and tiptoe out through the back kitchen in a cold sweat, lest the dog, who has grown to be fond of you, sudd  enly discern in you an arrant coward unworthy of his affect  ion and set up a barking that will wake the house. Some leaves, some gets put out, says Joe, to everyone's amazement, to his own dismay. Where in the world did the words come from? Lilian does no more than arch her pencill  ed brows. Jesus, says Patrick, the fellow must be drunk. Time, I think, says Lilian at last, time, gentlemen, please. f ","docTitle":"","docDate":"2014-07-01 09:48:36.952"},"meta":{"contentType":"text/raw","emVer":"7.1.1103.5","langIdVer":"DefaultLangId","processingVer":"CalaisJob01","submissionDate":"2014-07-01 09:48:33.566","submitterCode":"57b17a53-6e34-87b0-20ff-a419896f49c9","signature":"digestalg-1|B+/DDHB9f91ClyDMgKoEr+uEbOU=|WInJzM9HmVDN84mdnZBUiMlLW+Rnx2SNFjTKX3ri+uvfH0Peo4FydQ==","language":"English"}},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/de000ceb-9b70-3d63-b0ea-d3be9dc976bd/cat/1":{"_typeGroup":"topics","category":"http://d.opencalais.com/cat/Calais/HumanInterest","classifierName":"Calais","categoryName":"Human Interest","score":0.563},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/de000ceb-9b70-3d63-b0ea-d3be9dc976bd/lid/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http://d.opencalais.com/lid/DefaultLangId/English"},"http://d.opencalais.com/pershash-1/7f099d87-5345-30cb-8837-130d6fce1e9f":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"Person","name":"Pat","persontype":"N/A","nationality":"N/A","commonname":"Pat","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/Person","instances":[{"detection":"[us at Butlin's still.
