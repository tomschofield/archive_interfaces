Your best tactic is to avoid preconceptions, then choose whatever speaks most strongly to you.\u2019 In charcoal whorls, an elephant and hippo, baggy bulk conveyed by gradations of light and shade; portfolios on biblical themes; a series of Grassmarket down-and-outs drawn long before this became the fashion - ghosted features left to the imagination. At last I choose essence of sheep. Head down, grey streaks scoring the flanks, a pink blur across its back the only presence of colour, it captures the ambivalence of nature: one moment a celebratory leap into spring air; the next, world\u2019s weight, down-tug of gravity. At the mercy of irreconcilables, I marvel how in pen and ink or granite, he can impose such order; through controlled frenzy, convey the terror, and tenderness, of his inner eye. 71 \n￼Conn 32-80 3/5/95 11:00 pm Page 72 Boudin at the Burrell Astonishing how those tiny watercolours, blurry clusters of windblown promenaders with parasolsV washerwomen and shrimpers wading in th a shallows, should transpire to be so varieu.

Dreamer and loner, throughout his life he happily narrowed his horizons, enabling us to drink in those elements he made his own. The secret, his gift for capturing cloud formations, fine or bearing rain; their silky turbulence. Contemplating those bathing-boxes drawn by horses he was never the voyeur, detesting Trouville's summer masquerade of gilded parasites and poseurs. Nor fond of distances: as lengthy a journey as any when he died and was transported to be alongside his wife, in Montmartre. \n￼Search Several sightings: alone or with her daughter who vanished with her. Such distances impossible in the time, all dismissed as figments of the imagination. Until shreds of dress . j snagged on thorn, some with stains on them. Such occurrences more and more frequent; searches revealing little. Nor are real Muses readily found. Yet every so often the blood will leap to a shimmer as of white chiffon at the periphery of seeing: a lost fragment, drifting in the mind.

Upstairs, garish prints of tigers, a gouache of a man on a dromedary, decorative floribunda. But by far the most predatory creature there the girl who runs the gallery: night eyes; rhinestone rings on -sup ple/talons; tawny hair aslant, like a hawk\u2019s wing.

My affinity, I confess, ever with the twinkling eyed one: so much that he preoccupied my waking thoughts for years (only he could vouch for hours of sleep). Later I encountered another from the same mould: Konrad Lorenz, more mellow than rigid rules would allow - and so transposed them that one night I came across the analyst up to his waist in a smooth-flowing stream, hotly pursued by patients in the guise of greylag geese. 74 \n￼Conn 32-80 3/5/95 11:00 pm Page 7, o- 'K Strangers in the Night A fallen angel probably lurks within us all. JACK VETTRIANO Ways of dealing with dreams vary. We used to act complicitously - Nightmare Creatures, caught slithering across the sill, susceptible to taming; Wild Things which once overcome enabled you to settle down in an unmenaced cot, in the belief they helped you prepare for later life. Now press a button, you despatch your enemies; Fact or Fiction, simply blow them away. Adult desire and guilt conversely have a knack of gnawing remorselessly as when aroused by the caress and thrill of these canvases, scenes of dubious comings and goings, mesmerising liaisons, liquescent silk, nocturnal satin, louche entree to the imagination - till at the portals of the gallery, deciphering a spidery \u2018mysteriously troubling and melancholic\u2019 in the well-thumbed visitors\u2019 book you thrust your way outside for fear you can no longer hide that give-away glint in your eye, or keep Monsters within at bay. 75 \n￼Conn 32-80 3/5/95 11:00 pm Page 77 Lady Anne\u2019s Diary IOn her arrival \u2018Our messmates numbered about twenty-four, and we all got on like lambs...' Our party despatched, a sickly old viceroy\u2019s ears and eyes; chess-pieces for Henry Dundas. A disparate cargo: the crew and ourselves, a shipment of gun barrels for Bengal. Mercifully hitting it off. Not least John Barrow, man of infinite maps and charts intent on mastering the Interior (through whose inducement I\u2019d clamber up Table Mountain, himself happily wedding a girl from the Cape). To signal our approach, flags hoisted and cannon-fire, smoke-puffs dispersing over what had been for eight long days on our horizon. One summit a lion couchant, briefly as though in the lea of Arthur\u2019s Seat. A prime aim, to discover \u2018how far the same objects may appear alike in British and D utch eyes\u2019; construe the difference. f 77 \n￼Conn 32-80 3/5/95 11:00 pm Page 78 q IIn the Cape Soon established, besides the rat-tat familiar through haar from the Castle: on buffalo hide, an ominous pulsebeat. Ingrained, to make the Dutch good Englishmen: myself unprepared for such dominance - some up to seven feet, hefty for a minuet. (Later I recited Auld Robin Grey, as they sat morosely in their blue cloth jackets, incongruous top-hats.) In return, countenanced with a fixed smile feasts of aromatic nastiness; trestles boasting calf\u2019s head, horns boiled and all. Urged to avoid religion and politics even among ourselves (certain clerical goings-on irksome to my father-in-law, Bishop of Limerick). The Peninsula an objective, not as a vessel of milk and honey, vineyards and gleaming gables, but a slender sentinel to India. As for the wilderness beyond, savagery and worse. Constant whetting of War\u2019s cutlery. To secure this gateway, I fear many will die. 78 r \n￼Conn 32-80 3/5/95 11:00 pm Page 79 Reiterated, as time went on: \u2018the best thing for these Dutch, to take the oath of allegiance, who certainly will not see their flag fly again\u2019. Nor clandestine, but trilled by Macartney and his Generals at the tops of their voices: no need to intercept com m uniques, letters home. (My own origin conveniently forgotten, the injunction to quell \u2018the unruly Scots\u2019 indecorously bellowed in King George\u2019s anthem). Most onerous, keeping the peace: not between tribal factions, but one Officer and another, out to make a reputation; resorting minimally to sleight of hand, whether in Love or War. The winners, consistently those who hold their liquor. These evenings see us playing croquet on the residency lawns; so still the air the gum-trees decked with candles, like chandeliers. My husband up-country I lie awake in the small hours counting gourds clicking through hoops, kissing like heads in a basket. 79 \n￼NOTES Kilmarnock Edition (page II): The first edition of Poems, Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect by Robert Burns, 1786. Norman Collie at Sligachan Inn (pages 60-61): Collie (1859-1942), mountain climber and pioneer, who as a biochemist discovered the properties of neon. A.F. M um m ery died on Nanga Parbat, and controversy followed the loss of four of Edward Whymper\u2019s party on the Matterhorn. The prefatory quote is from Norman Collie: a life in two worlds by Christine Mill (AUP, 1987). Air and Water (page 62): John Muir (1838-1914) was aged eleven when his father emigrated from Dunbar, to America. He is renowned (and has belatedly been recognised in his own land) as an explorer, naturalist, author, and \u2018father of Conservation\u2019. My fascination for him was rekindled through directing James Rankin\u2019s play Yosemite. C ontrasts (page 66): Hamilton Mausoleum with its 15-second echo was built by the 10th Duke to house himself and his ancestors. The Adam hunting-lodge of Chatelherault dates from the 1730s; burnt and vandalised earlier this century, it was acquired by the nation and restored. Tc M aori (page 69): The Te Maori (Taonga vWaon/Treasures of the Maori) Exhibition in the early 80s launched Maori society and culture on the world. I am indebted to Carol O\u2019Biso\u2019s remarkable account of its American tour, First Light (Heinemann, 1987). Lady Anne\u2019s Diary\u2019 (pages 77-79): Daughter of the fifth Earl of Balcarres, Lady Anne Barnard was admired for her verve, wit and intelligence- in Edinburgh and at the Court of George III. She accom panied her husband to the Cape in 1797 on his appointm ent by Henry Dundas (later Lord Melville) as secretary to the Governor Lord Macartney.
