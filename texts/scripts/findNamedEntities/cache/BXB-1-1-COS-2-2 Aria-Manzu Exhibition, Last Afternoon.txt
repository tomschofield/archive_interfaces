Our rowing-boat drifts on, with scarcely a ripple. Suddenly the surface quivers: the fish leaps into the air, then splashes back on its belly. As though you, lying there in drugged sleep, were totally to ignore my kisses, a moment later to reappear singing an aria from 'Cosi fan Tutti'. I \n￼THE BOATHOUSE The boathouse is the worse for wear: cracked pantiles let in rain; a shutter is unhinged, the pocked weather-vane broken by some local sharp-shooter. The landing-stage too has seen better days, its boards rotting. Yet we visit whenever we can this fading Estate, skirting the big house and the love temple, with its beeches and planned rhododendrons. Onemanhastakentheplaceofeight gamekeepers. Nor do minor Royalty come as they did, to bag the occasional deer or hold their swinging parties. Envisage the locals, deferential; the young gentry, on holiday from boarding school in the south, disporting themselves nightly. See the ice-buckets bead, the champagne flow. The wendy-house on the island, overgrown now, must have held many a Chekhovian scene, or Bacchanalian, girls with flimsy dresses, hair gossamer in the breeze; sheep's carcasses, breeding maggots on which the brown trout fed, straddled on wires, across the water's surface. Strange that our presence should overlay theirs as we manoeuvre our clinker-built boat in pursuit of stocked rainbows where, in early summer, the mountain-ash extend their candelabra. What will the future bring? Can one owner with propriety retain such inherited grandesse? Yet how transfer so inaccessible a property, as some would decree, to the down-trodden? No ready solution. Our own, who knows, may come to be counted among 'those balmy days'. Two Harrier jets wheel overhead; a reminder of other priorities. Their roar lingers long after they disappear. Time to row in. The boathouse shimmers, in the aftermath of rain. A mink, predator of a different order, swims to the bank, a fish in its jaws. In the subsequent near-silence, intensified by our bow-ripple, I realise we have not seen or heard the peregrine, this season: like ourselves, an endangered species. \n￼BIRD SONGS Starling Leave me be, to chirp those notes natural to me. Why should I aspire to the nightingale's RP, the career cadences of thrush and blackie? I'm merely the back-court piper of gable walls, fag-end of a raucous tradition; chatterer on roof-trees - see it how you please. Nor am I wholly aloof: the others may not be my cup of tea, but I'll sit on a telegraph-wire all day, listening happily as their songs pass me by. Bittern Think of the years I threw away, down there, intent on selling my wares, when all they cared for was the phoney falsetto of canaries in cages, or at a pinch, the Home Counties' dawn chorus - twitterersinhedgerows. Suchexpenditure ofenergy: I'dhavechangedregister even, to fit in. But those days are gone. Life began again, when I joined the brass section. \n￼RESIDENT Finding a convenient five-barred gate I hitch a trouser-leg up and adopt a proprietorial pose. Trouble is, I can't keep my face straight. For one thing I haven't the right garb, and however levelly I gaze out am not even an absentee landlord, more a temporary tenant, this visit. That apart I still carry the flab I'm here to get rid of. I'll acclimatise as soon as my boots are broken in and the war with the horse-flies is won. Conspicuous meantime, in a landscape complete without me, I'll make a start by cutting the grass, in the hope of damping that wren's derisive flute. / \n￼BIRD OF PASSAGE Alexander Wilson: b. Paisley, Scotland 1766; d. Southwark, Philadelphia 1813 [for Tom Leonard] The starlings that roosted in Paisley Abbey's squat hulk, accumulating layers of lime, have long since gone, without recognising the rara avis to whom late last century a statue was raised: Alexander Wilson, who flew through life like a highly coloured bird. For chastising such silky muck-worms as his Hollander who resisted Reform, and scoun'rel Shark, trig in his powdered wig, measures fixed to cheat his weavers, Wilson was hounded by a less than enamoured constabulary. Plucking his tail feathers, they locked him in the tolbooth; his verses, a friend to Liberty, suppressed and burnt. After Thomas Muir's transportation, the judiciary preparing its grapeshot, he felt it wise to jump bail, sailing by way of Portpatrick and Belfast for Philadelphia. Jack-of-all-trades but unable to endure life's collisions, he scraped a living; till he fell for the warbler's song, the allure of orchard orioles, their nests suspended from twigs on fibre hooked and wound with an ingenuity he, a weaver, had to admire. Warming to the task of a lifetime he persuaded a publisher to take on his magnum opus, 'Birds of America'; seeking subscribers by horse and canoe, from the St Lawrence to the Mississippi; meeting Jefferson and Thomas Paine. A woodpecker, locked in his Wilmington hotel-room, made a start on a mahogany table; while a kite, sinking a talon to the bone and released by severing a sinew of its heel, confirmed its existence. A phantom flycatcher, his sole aberration, purloined \n￼by Audubon. Father of American Ornithology, did he ponder the perplexed cartography ofRenfrewshire; engravingsuntinted, new species unnoted, had he not departed? Later, as he lay dying from dysentry brought on by swinming in pursuit of a wounded plover, did his thoughts migrate to the Abbey grounds where he stands opposite Robert Tannahill, friend and fellow-poet, who unable to find a publisher stepped into the Candren Bum, top-coat folded on the bank, silver fob-watch beside it? \n￼FAMILY TREE 'And Wba shall be able ta stan Pc^ared for the great Bridal feast, Chly they wba obey the coimand Aid escape the made o the Beast. It will come like the crack o a gin Aid the door for ever clink ta. Fbw, few shall hear the well dene And the many be left ta their wae.' In faded photographs, vanished generations display shovel beards and gold watch-chains. Here and there a sheepish smile; but in the main they confront the future with old-fashioned steadfastness of gaze. Flanked by cousins, austere in their Sunday best, stands my great-uncle Todd Cochrane, supplier of horses to the Cavalry during World War I - whom as a boy I imagined careering round Ayrshire astride one of his stallions. Churchill to him a warmonger, Stalin the Red Dragon of the Apocalypse, he'd recite chapter and verse, the big Bible on his knee; once sacking a land-girl for whistling on the sabbath. Charged by the Holy Ghost, he and his sisters burst in on my father, studying for the ministry, to announce the Second Coming of Christ. The War over, a voice from Heaven assured them the World would end at noon next day: would he climb Craigie Hill with them, to pray. They succeeded, unaided, inkeepingthelasttrumpatbay; thereafter going into retreat, Martha staying 'with friends' for a spell; the matter unlikely to have been spoken of again had not Todd, on his death-bed, complained of '...live coals, in the brain'. \n￼CRAGGY COUNTRY Tales of Craigie Hill occupy my memory: how at Mungo Farquhar's comer a pony and trap, come recklessly adrift, sent driver and passenger plummeting; the crazed beast, flecked with foam, finally caught and quietened outside the creamery, at Riccarton road-end. I would think of this, as among empty churns or clinging to the tail-gate, I ascended throughmorningmisttothefarm: those earlier generations like speeded-up figures in Chaplin films; the frame frozen on Sundays, men's boots gleaming, women in black lace. Later, on my second-hand Raleigh racer with drop handle-bars, I'd zig-zag uphill, squirmingonthenarrowsaddle; onthereturn journey imagining myself the first Scotsman ever to win the Tour de France. Once, eager to catch the cricket at Kirkstyle, I cut things too fine and leaving my machine described an arc in mid-air, in slow motion, before landing; then headed painfully home with the crumpled wheels and buckled frame all grass and mud - object of derision as townie come a cropper, or country buffoon. \n￼ILLUSIONISTS The Great Levant could make an elephant appear where there had been thin air, a moment before. Robert Houdin would saw his blonde assistant in half, then restore her 'before your very eyes'. Easy to laugh now, at the sleazy razzmatazz - because we know itwasalldonewithmirrors; orrecalltherow we sat in, in Kilmarnock's Palace Theatre, while a 'volunteer' vouched for a fiver that the blunt-edged sword-ladder Kalanag climbed barefoot was sharp as a razor. So my wonder-box, its fluttering silk squares, the snowman ghost-tube stocked with spring flowers, even the gleaming dove-pans, ultimately lost their allure and were given away. But I remember Chung Ling Soo used to catch a bullet fired across the stage, in his teeth: until one night he was accidentally shot in the head. How ironic with his final trick, to prove Death no fake. \n￼JANACEK QUARTET As we listen the virtuosity of the music quickens, its frenzy catching love's expectancy; then gives way to the reverie conveying the features of the girl he'd fallen for. For me it is yours, not hers, it captures: so that I too would rather it were on the viola d'amore. \n￼THE EYE-SHADE Finding this eye-shade on the kitchen table and putting it on, I am able for the first time to counteract the glare from the desk-light in my study. Your father wore it latterly, to protect failing eyesight. Now in minute part, I can inhabit his world, gauge its curve, grow sensitive to its more manageable perspective. His spectrum, we knew, had been restricted; his Emerald Isle made more so, as predicted - each image on his television screen, not only grass and baize, reduced to green. The eye-shade would have been appropriate if, earlier, he could have worn it when burning the midnight oil, as editor of the Abbey's monthly newsletter. Truly, what intervening object can impede the vision of the good? Nor can his shade do us harm, if it focuses the mind on others, or induces an old age in which like him we conquer, with verve and humour, bereavement and despair: a lovely man, most distant yet most dear. \n￼BUTTERFLY FARM \"Within this animal group with its reputation for irritation, disease and destruction, exist some of the most captivating creatures on Earth\": not Man - but the 170,000 species of moths and butterflies comprising the order Lepidoptera. Thewordconjuresupladies in long skirts, eccentric professors, rows of bodies transfixed under glass cases. The butterfly farm repudiates this picture. The air vibrant with patterns and colour, in a tropical environment exotic larvae pursue their daily routine, silky pupae emerge to beauty: Common Grass Yellow, Great Orange Tip, Blue Swallowtail, all here, along with Monarch, crepuscular Owl. An order exists, secure under nets, which we might envy, given the threats ourworldpresents. Buthowsafewouldwebe, even if protected from the equivalent of birds that fly and free to flutter like these, with only Chinese quails harmlessly grubbing below, puffballs on wheels? \n￼2 POEMS [for Norman MacCaig, cm his 80th birthday] Profile Like a ship's prow cleaving dark waters, imagine him, gliding into Lochinver leaving a phosphorescent trail. Or more at home still, on Suilven, aslant to the wind; no mists unsettling that lucid mind. The skull could be weathered stone, but too thinking, feeling. Paradox: amountainpeak itself a source of light. Odd looking back, the attempts to scotch him - who undeviating has enriched Scottishness through its encompassing him. Nor one for pomposity he could turn plaudits topsy-turvy; with deserved laurels crowned, might munch the leaves, one by one. Suilven After a long day on obdurate lochans I ended up unable to see for driving rain, and night falling. Suddenly there loomed over me an outcrop stem and uncanny, yet vaguely familiar: not Wordsworth's craggy \n￼steep, or the Brocken (conditions were wrong) but MacCaig's profile a mile high, where Suilven had been. This of course his territory. From the peat-track, I looked back: on the horizon was Suilven again; but glancing on the lochans between, a luminescence I could only call the ghost of a smile. \n￼MANZU EXHIBITION, LAST AFTERNOON \"His style is necessarily figurative because the figure, as an entity in its own right, is the pivot around which Manzu's pictorial world moves.\" [Giulio Carlo ArganJ Do I see you through his eyes or my own, fragile girl poised on the rim of a chair too high for you? For what house-party or play were you dressing up? Such haughtiness of expression, mouth turned down at the comers, eyes with a Japanese slant, you seem simultaneously come-hitherish and shy, as if saying, \"Capture I defy you, the evanescence of this moment\": which is precisely what the sculptor has done. Closing time approaches. Uniformed attendants unhinge wooden shutters. Footsteps click on the polished floor as hushed visitors, ourselves among them, scurry for a last glimpse of a favourite piece - with in the centre room that slouched Cardinal, dominant as on a throne. Reverberant doors slam. Rather than imagine the sculptures imprisoned in darkness, alone, I sense the pervading presence of an elderly man in an accustomed jacket and soft hat; hands, unable to dissimulate, kneadingclaylikedough: sointense the humanity with which he imbues his figures, they resonate in the memory - incomparable bronzes, lubricated by light.
