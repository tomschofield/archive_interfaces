Your Stetson is a fine speaker, says the Marquis, and it's heartening for you no doubt to hear the voice of enthusiasm from time to time. He frightens me though. I'm afraid there'd be no room for me in his wew Jerusalem. Nor for Bassett either, I remark. It was he who now made an interjection in his queru  lous way. Where's the Captain? he asked. What right's he got to sit in the warm and us out here? T'int fair. Think I come out of Saint Camilla's to sit in a morgue all day having my brains bashed out? Thereupon the Ape: Number one, Billy Bassett! Always Number one. My nerves is in shreds, these lads'll vouch for that, what I've been through lately chasing after that ungrate  ful little dick, you'll excuse his filthy mouth, Mrs Clack, in Stoke, how d'you think I feel sitting here with horrible dead things dropping on me out of the blue? Pat said it reminded him of the Blitz, or the Zeppelin raids, he couldn't remember which. Finest hour, said Stetson, a packet of Woodbines cost three ha'pence and there was no cheeking your elders. I went to look for the Captain. Little Hitler in his jack  boots, the Ripper at his thigh, jerked a thumb knowingly down the corridor. I knocked, I entered. Poor crumpled man. They've declared peace, Nobby, he said, they've totted up the scores and called it a draw, we're too late, we're redundant again, it's all been labour in vain. Never a word of warning and you'll not tell me they didn't know. They don't pack up on the spur of the moment, these things need planning. Truth is, no-one cares. I'm left to hear it on the radio. It's nothing to them that you dear lads have put in all those hours. And Stanley's gone. We broke .his heart. And others, I 'spect, will never be the same again. We're forgotten men, that's what, up here miles away from Whitehall. Perhaps they'd never have bothered discontinuing us and we'd have carried on for ever, until we'd -finished done the whore of Babylon, mother of harlots and abominations, they'd have let us finish perhaps, and laughed in our faces, me and all you lads. A pigeon broke your gramaphone, 1 say. That's it then. That is it. I'll tell the troops, I say. Poor man, says the Widow, it's him I feel for. what's it matter \n￼266 to the likes of that there Bassett whether you're doing a use  ful job of work or not? hut the uap*tain's had an education and he's bound to feel these things, in the morgue, nrs Clack, the pigeons were dropping like stones. Several of my comrades had been struck but all remained patiently at their places as I had left them waiting for word what to do next. They'd be there yet, says Bowles, if you hadn't gone back for 'em. Of course, in our hearts we'd been expecting it a^id^Mrs Clack may is right and a man like Bassett or the Grampus doesn't much mind whether he's put to good use or to none. But a roar went up when I told 'em the show was over. They roared and cursed and swore they'd have compensation. Naturally, says the Marquis, no man in their position lets the chance of a grudge go by. What a head of indignation your Ape has, for example, what a capital of injustice. I felt no anger myself, I felt some pity but more a wonderful excitement. Preserve us, the Widow squeaks. Leave the Good Book open, lads, I cried, leave it lying open where we got to, which was the final wisdom of Solomon, 1 Kings, 11, him showing his backside to Jehovah and turning full frontal to the lovely Ashtoreth. Remember, lads, I said- and you're to pic  ture me standing in the doorway of daylight and the great iron key in my right hand- remember, I cried, as they trailed moaning out, that man when offered his heart's desire by God in a dream asked not for health and wealth but for understanding and God 4° was tha-t-pleased he chortled like Father Christmas in the Brit  ish Home Stores when some kiddy,\u2014 omarter than the i'csi;, and gave it him and threw the wealth and the health in too. What a. feller, eh? For didn't the Queen of Sheba travel miles to have a look at him? God might have known as^her sort took an interest that his blue-eyed boy would weigh the odds and turn against him in the end. Nobody listened. Coffey 1 cried, lasting till lunch no doubt. And ask for a drop of rum in it, he'll not say no. Ask and it shall be given for the need to conciliate you again is very great. Alone in the morgue I was silenced by a terrific sad  ness. My excitement was attacked, you might say, by the giant rats of grief. T-h4-wk of it n-t-rnggling fm- riMn lift? whi1o\u2014T contimw. We heard all this before, says Walter, last time you got knocked back, you shutting up shop and telling us how you felt. There's a good deal of recurrence in most people's lives, I re  ply. Things come round again but of course we're that much older and we feel it worse. It'll not go on for ever, you know. Besides, \n￼to see the galloping majorettes in little pieces and the green baize turntable wobbling like a drunk would have moved most men to tears. And dust and cobwebs and years of excrement dislodged by the pigeons in their clearing out were already settling on the long trestle tables, the open books and the cardboard boxes waiting for the first- and never completed- batch. The priapic kings still lay in a heap at the far end, grey with dust. The cadavers of frozen birds had fallen on them too. Even now, Mrs Clack, the rats will be scaling that mountain of male pride. I\u2019ll never see my Captain in his high chair again. Perhaps no-one will^and it won't be long before the Grampus or Bassett perhaps will say they weren't bad times, when you weigh up they were something to look back on after all,the Captain up there in his fur coat giving us a lead and Cacky cranking his fuck  ing arm off and Look Homeward Angel coming out of the ear- trumpet, it wasn't so bad, even the cold you got used to it, and we had some fun,^we snapped the icicles off old Pat's nose and threw 'em at the Ape, we had a laugh and even Stet  son will concur in his heart of hearts and a longing for the good old days when we were all together with our bits of pencil will take him by the throat. The Widow dabs her eyes. It's the pigeons I care about she says. To think of 'em ly- A, ing there and their brothers and sisters flying off to Africa. Thank goodness for conversation, says the Marquis. I mean, I can imagine your day must have been prercty difficul~t\u2014to >j 'get through suddenly put out of work like that and the snow so thick you couldn't even take a walk around the fence. The gas was very low, I say, we were barely visible to one anoth  er in the green and cream canteen. Man here, said Pat, peer  ing close, ate nothing but carrots for seven years. Bright or  ange when he died. His missus said he was a heljath fanatic. To think, I thought, my Caspar cannot read such things. Did he work at his letters, Did you not help him, two or three hours a day, pointing along the words with your hairy fat forefinger? Waste of time, grandad. Fact is, he hasn't got it up here (taps his heavy conk). Besides, he doesn't want to learn. All he wants to do is sit on his fanny all day watch  ing out for you know who. Yes, I say, that poor child deserted the Ape and went down to Stoke, a terrible place by all accounts, in search of his sweetheart, who was lodging, so he believed, 267 \n￼268 with her old gran. The Ape lay in jail, accused of stealing a soil pipe, and Caspar made it overnight into the Potter  ies through the courtesy of two long-distance lorry drivers and a Professor of Moral Philosophy, a basoonist and, as he soon confessed, a bigamist who, on the pretence of attend  ing an academic conference, had left the first of his wives and was travelling to rejoin the second and could offer Caspar a lift back north again in three days time. But Cas  par, arrived in Stoke, had no wish to leave that place, not without Jo at least. He asked an inspector in the bus stat  ion (in whose lavatories the Professor was changing his clothes, for he made it a rule never to appear before the second of his wives as he appeared before the first; whether he happened to know Jo's gran, but the inspector could not help Caspar: can't help you, son, he said. Caspar, pennil  ess, accepted breakfast of the emerged Professor and asked him also whether he knew Jo's gran. The Professor shook his head, he was a poor one to ask, he said, he never went out but kept indoors, doing the odd jobs husbands ought to do. Good luck in your search, young fellow, he said. Love is a terrible thing. And gave him half a crown. bo Caspar was sitting in the Market Place watching in all directions for his sweetheart when the Ape arrived and said: we need more information, kid.^Simple, he smirked, you look her gran up in the phone book. But for want of a surname or two they got nowhere on this one and the Ape sat down next to Caspar with his thinker's head in his hands. The hours passed. Caspar sent Ape to buy a pie. Ta, he said, you watch that way I'll watch this.But the Ape had never met the girl and Caspar's description of her- she got big eyes- was less than adequate. Besides, how long ago was that? She's had a kiddy since, she'll have filled out a bit. Wo, she was thin, thinner au The nips than most boys are, her breasts easily concealed under her hands. The Ape guffaws, how long ago was that? And wearing jeans, with his name and hers and an arr  ow and a heart in biro on the knee. And flat shoes, good for running in. Her knickers? the Ape asked with his heaviest sarcasm. Navy blue, given her in the hospital. So now we know what we're looking for. But his heart wasn't in it. What of their sexual and sentimental life during this time? the Marquis asks. Almost nothing needs to be said of it, I \n￼269 reply. A mercy, says the Widow. In drink the Ape described to all and sundry how he had been put out of his friend's affections through no fault of his own; but it got him no sympathy, only ridicule and once or twice a beating. When / he came in tears to Caspar and displayed his cuts/and said that's the thanks I get the boy only shrugged and told him to keep his big mouth shut, Stoke was no place for pufters and he didn't want any rough stuff coming his way, he'd finished with all that, what he wanted was a proper family life. Then with a grin he offered the Ape his (the Ape's) three favourite things- one now and two to follow- if he'd go north again and find out what her gran was called and where she lived. The Ape refused, drank for another week and said alright he would. By that time he was tired of Stoke and very down in the mouth about Caspar. Went to the NAB and got a travel voucher to visit his mother dying of cancer in Darlington and claimed his first instalment of Caspar in a derelict chapel behind the cattle marker. Set off, and blew in here.Not going back, he says. The kid can come to him. No way for a lad his age to spend his time, the Widow says. Mind, she says, I blame the father in most cases. Too many no-hopers on the streets today, says Walter, it's de  pressing. The Grampus took a different view, I say. We had this over coffee, don't forget, and the Grampus said he didn't think it was such a bad life sitting in the square all day, under a statue say or on a public bench, watching the people coming and going. Once the weather improved, as it surely would, he could think of worse ways of passing the time. Can o' beer perhaps and the day went quickly en  ough. You sit on your bum and grin and shake your wondering head and hear the clockstrike all the quarters and think I'll have a piss and you go belowand hold your prick and squirt a bit and fart and say that's better*,that's much bett  er, and look up mebbe and see the soles of citizens on the op  aque glass above your nob and think that's funny and climb out again and hear the hour,th±»k and before you know it it'll be time for tea. Stetson was furious, of course. Then bo-bos, he snarled, and another step nearer your grave, not that you'll notice in your case, not that it'll make a ha'porth of differ  ence, but there's men in here, one anyway, wants more out of \n￼270 life than wondering whether you want«C another piss or not. At this point the Captain joined us. Mind if I join you? he asked. By all means, sir, I said. We were discussing ways of passing the time. The Grampus here is of the opinion that given reasonable weather, a man might do worse than sit in a public square all day and watch the world go by. Stetson was opposing him vigorously, as you might expect, now was he look  ing? the Widow asks. Your Captain, I mean. A shade greyer, Mrs Clack, his voice less commanding. When I told him what our topic was he bowed his head. Ah, he said, time on our hands \u2022 I wish those chaps in pinotripe-s could be here now and see what unemployment does to lads like you. There were tears in his eyes when he said this. Of course, we did our best to console him. Captain, I said, this snow won't last for ever. I'll bet we're in for a fine end of April and a glorious May. What about extending the vegetable patch and trying our hands at somihing new this year, artichokes for example? Our fighting men will be hungry when they get home and the least a grateful motherland can do is feed 'em prop  erly. Then there's that bit of land feo&raid going to waste be  hind the wash-houses, I've often thought it would make a very nice assault course. Our Danny's been taking a big in  terest in body-building lately, we could mebbe hang a few old tyres up for him to swing from. Yes, said the Grampus, what I likes is sitting here listening to you lads having your conversations. No need to worry about me, you know, it'll be dinner time soon and then i'll have forty winks. Not a bad life really, though he moans a bit, he'd like more time in bed of course, he'd like another hot water bottle, his feets is cold, he's been getting a lot of wind lately, his ticker's flurtery, his back passage is red raw, but not a bad life Captain, there's plenty worse and don't go fixing up things for him to do, he's enough on his plate as it is what with getting up of a morning and going to the lav and chewing his bacon and wondering what's for d-inner. Stetson was livid. The higher orders haven't a chance, he said, and it's true I'd put my money on the Grampus to keep going longest in the race of life. That fucker'll outlive the lot of us, is how Stetson put it. We were beginning the interesting topic of longevity- whether by a wholly monotonous regime a man might not carry on for ever\u2014 when Bluebeard and his faithful alsatian Hammer approached our table. Beg pardon, sir. Two men out there want \n￼in. Familiar? the Captain asked? Very, was the reply. And have they drink on them? A little, sir. Shall I send them walk-about? How are they dressed? the Captain asked. Two shoes between them, sir, one sports-jacket. Hats? One edit  or's green eyeshade. Poor devils, said the Captain, drink or no drink, let them in. Savage, I'll bet, says Bowles. In  deed, I reply, and the Cobbler with him* The Cobbler had frostbite.,since over the last three miles it was Savage's turn for the shoes. Both men, when I had hos  ed them down, tingled throughout with chilblains. It's amaz  ing what the human frame will stand, the Marquis says. Smudg- er!s a gonner, Savage said, scouring his blotchy body with a grey towel. They left him torkeling in the fast lane on Chester Moor. His head was away, he was showing the world, in poor visibility however, his magnificently tattoed chest. Snow on its grey hair. You left him there? I asked. No option, bonny lad, he was away. Never leave your mate, said the Cobb  ler, raising a blue and red finger, except in an emergency. The Baron's gone, he swapped his bowler for a panama and a bottle of brown and the wind blew, on the road north it was, and his baldness was grievously pelted with dobbers of hail. The jake warmed him however and we mayhhope that he died with  out waking. He lies on a slab in Gosforth now, with a ticket round his toe. Mick lives, he would, in a threadbare tuxedo and no shirt, poor chetif toothless forty-year-old juvenile, lay on a doorstep breathing his last and a kindly widow op  ened to let the cat in. Who made it south? Did any to Walkden where the rain is warmer? Any as far as Camberwell where the sun never sets? No word of any. But a man from Walkden was seen on broken knees in Spennymoor clutching a letter of in  troduction to the landlady of the Knicky Knack Guest House and complaining that conditions down there surpassed belief. And. in Camberwell, he had heard a fugitive on his last legs croak, such a reign of terror had been instigated by a new incumbent fired with zeal, that even the rats were packing their bags and leaving. Here Slim was able to make an observ  ation. Saw it in the Gorbals once, he said. One o' they slum- clearance jobs. There were that many of-\u2014l-ctb-it stopped the traffic, took 'em hours to pass, all heading west in thous  ands across the road. The wish to better themselves, said Stetson, every man not hopelessly degenerate feels it. But \n￼272 seriously, said the Captain, perking up a little, why leave? Why ever do you chaps want to leave? Haven't we got it cosy here? Look at the frightful weather. And here we are by gas  light, lunch not far off- steak and kidney, I believe, with bread and butter pudding for afters- and Savage is looking Kt human again and even the Cobbler, once his fee-t go down, will be fit for another few rounds. Aye, aye, sir, said the Cobbler, Matron says I shouldn't lose more than three. Well there you are, said the Captain, things could be worse, things could always be worse. Why leave? It's the spark of life, said Stetson. Who moves is not quite dead. He's been there twenty years, says Walter, to my certain knowledge. And never a d-anight out, says Pat. Do as I say, »a I say, not as I do. Leave then. For ex  ample, Arthur's gone. That first hot day he grinned his grin and left. But he'll be back. Not before Michaelmas he won't. He'll have done his tour, he'll have stretched his legs. Reg  ular as Nature, like a bird or something. Yes, says the Wid  ow, like a pigeon. And news will come to the stay-at-homes that he's been seen in Darlington, Northallerton and in some of the moorland villages and resorts along the coast, he sees the world, he sees a bit of it at least, the same bit every year, same month, same day almost, and the good people in those parts have had the pleasure of seeing him. In Thirsk, for ex  ample, they've said by jove here's Arthur again it's time I cleaned the gutters out, and in Stokcsley on the Green a Mrs P°6gy» bad on her feet, reaches for the pair of socks she'a had laid by for Arthur. Yes, says the Marquis, his eyes shin  ing, that man's a bonus. Mrs Clack, gentlemen, I drink to him. He doesn't hide his light under a bushel, he doesn't bury his talent, he goes forth into the villages, io^^h^^cad^bury^-the d-ead is his motto. How very brave, how very encouraging of him to, set out every year like that. Why, if I lived in the back and beyond, in Goathland, say, or Toad Hole or Cockayne, and was so fortunate as to lie along his route, I'd look forward to his coming as though he were a snowdrop or an angel. Face like a chimpanzee, says Pat. Except in drink, then indescribable. Nevertheless, says the Marquis, he's a sign, he's more than he is. Deep, says the Widow, you're very deep. Can't leave yourself behind, says Bowles. That's why it's not \n￼worthwhile 'em bothering most of 'em. He means wherever you go, on foot or in a wagon from the abattoir or riding the rods to Denver or lying low in a stoke-hole all the way to Okinawa, wherever you land younestill your mother's son, you smell the same, you go to a bar, you open your mouth and the same old moans come out. Your guts? They gripe. Your legs? They ache, iour toenails wherever you are are coming off. That's true of course, says the Marquis. I suppose I was think  ing of Arthur more from the world's point of view than from his. There's for and against, says Joe. Hold your noise, says the Widow, Mr worn was about to say something. I was about to say that Old Misery over there is forgetting the possibility that the journey itself might work a miraculous change in a man. It would need to in your case, says the Widow. No, but tho embrace of rota's a powerful deadener of a man's spirit, says the Marquis. I learned that when I was do  ing time for Jesus. Eating and praying and sweeping the corrid  or, time passed like clockwork and after a week you couldn't imagine any other way of doing things^, carrying on. Nones did for you, old chap, and lauds and compline and the bell and I v/onder if they made you colour in capital letters in the freez  ing cold. Out there beyond the terminus of the deadwood stage we begin with a klaxon and the yapping of the dogs, then slops and sluice and foregather for breakfast then and then for el^ren- ses and then for lunch and then foregather for tea, foregather for supper, and bong, lights out, with tasks in between, more or less strenuous, more or less manifestly futile, digging holes and filling 'em in, painting coal white, fixing sky hooks, stacking tins of elbow grease, and mouth meanwhile, the same old pleasantries, and news of deaths and fantastic goings on. Yap, yap, yap. No wonder the Ape jumps up and says he can't stand it, his nerves is in shreds, he'll catch the 67 and go and slit his throat on his mother's grave in Langley Moor. Moor, how much more, and how much longer his mother's grave in Lang  ley? It's astonishing what the human heart can stand, says the Marquis. Year in, year out. It's hard to remember sometimes who's still with us and who isn't. And if they've gone have they gone for good or are they put away/ And put away where? Which circle are they in? Are they under screws, or under red blankets in St Camilla.'s,or between electric earplugs on the 273 \n￼funny farm? Behind wire or walls or soundproof glass or bounc  ing harmlessly in a padded cell or sorted under several others in a tier of bunks or laid like one in a body-count along a ward or trudging in a compoundf Some inside. But some in this silly season are all for embracing the great outdoors, which is the shattered spikey sky, the morning's sick,all-uvei yuu> the dredge and hawk of bile, your feet, your hurting feet. What Caspar feared most was the nights, and who can blame himr he sobbed with relief when he woke up in one piece. By late morning he was possessed completely by the fear of the evening and a terrible anxiety over where he would lay his head. His thoughts dwelled on broken glass, the teasing mice and the tugg' ing rats. He had a horror, as we all do, of being chased to and fro by lads on motorcycles. He wet himself, as who would not, at the sight under a lamp-post of an idle gang in drains and beetle-crushers, in braces and cherry-red DM*s, or flying boots and pissy originals. He more than suspected, and who among us will assure him of the contrary? that thoy wcro oo htrred kicking kids like him in was their pastime. In fear of the nights he sought admission behind our friendly wire, but before he had got into a nice routine and before 1 was able to do very much about his education the Ape turned his head and they set off together for the Southern Continent. But who could forget the morning of Slim's departure to join his sister in a council flat in East Kilbride? It was little more than a month since he had hurled himself bodily through the wire to be possessed, so he had roared, for ever of his heart\u2019s darling, Mo. Last we saw of him that day he was on the skyline with the tart in his arms. He\u2019ll be back, said the Cap  tain, but could not rest and like the Good Shepherd must go out in the night with^walking stick and his carbide lamp. I can't rest, Nobby, he said to me. I'm afraid his cuts will have open  ed with the exertion. Of his discovery of the errant pair- towards dawn in the outside lavatories of a school in Pity Me- the Captain could never bring himself to speak. Swinish and innocent, he muttered. Slim was sobbing and his shirt was full of blood. What a homecoming. But all that was behind him and wouldn't you think he would have learned his lesson and would sit tight ever after and be thankful for small mercies- the salt and vinegar, the ketchup, \n￼the dopey fire- and not go gallivanting off again? But no. He was jumpy. When Gob, for a lark, crept up and farted in his sleeping lug poor Slim, done scarlet down one side by the roaring fire, clutched at his heart and opened his white eyes as wide as a squid's. Poor chap, the Captain said to me, what's the matter with himf It was shame, I suppose, and love too, though he never mationed Mo. And he's frightened* Nobby, the Captain said. He's afraid there'll be repercussions. I shan't report the fesee fence, of course, I've assured him of that. It's like a reflex, Captain, I replied. He loved that lady and what follows love in men like us is fear. Follows by a law, like what goes upsky must come downsky. He's frightened now. He probably thinks he'll go to th^y^-11 put him-in prison for it and the screws will bootblack him. So Slim was drinking whatever he could. Cack found things on his travels and Dougie had a bottle from the Doctor for washing out his eye and they weren't the sort to let a man who's gasping go without. But worse, Slim had a treble win at Doncaster. Loud with his luck he burst through the wire again. He had a morbid fear of open spaces and was perhaps of all men most at home under the hoops of a nissen hut. The black tatie fields, the dripping sky, the unbending road filled him with dread. He took two or three of the lads with him as boosters and hit town at a jog-trot. Though not a gen  erous man he watered all and sundry copiously until he had momentum. The bar was like a blizzard with pound notes, eye  witnesses say. The rest is a roaring and a smashing of glasses as, full of courage, he put all his little tug boats off and took to the streets alone with money in his ham-sized fists. Outside the Bridge he destroyed a new Ford Popular with his head and feet, outside the Gardener's he flattened a belisha beacon. But leaving the Elm Tree he ran out of control down the cobbled bank and hit the wall of the Fighting Cocks. This withstood him and he collapsed. The Law arrived. The usual, with criminal damage, the Captain fetched him home. I'll put in a word for you, he said, when you come up. Say you've had emotional worries, that sort of thing. Only sit quiet now, there's a good chap. But it was then Slim re  membered his sister's assurance, given years ago, that there would always be a bed for him at her place.
