(1ike that woman who when I asked why she drank so replied 'I live in mortal fear of dehydration' and, later, 'I'd have drowned myself years ago but for my parents, , their feelings, ya know' and when she kissed me at the Christmas party sitting among dead needles under the tree her thirst was terrible and we swayed to her place each hoping the other had the bottle - 'I wake up each morning, trying to forgive myself' - and the streets of Edinburgh were white and not in order and on the windscreen a human finger had written Peece - God luvs you and it went under our defences and she began to weep ... That woman with the hair colour of bracken in wet autumn. \n￼sleeps alone and reads thrillers much of the night waiting for the world to confirm her suspicions 'of herself/1 so it will 'And after all what's positive thinking but a prolonged effort to kid yoursel - and really, who can afford to go south in winter?' This little late night reading is for her among others for how could I forget not recognise or fail to love my own and braver sister?) \n￼INTO THE HIGH ATLAS 'Dust on our bags and our capes.' Nose clogged, throat choked, couldn't speak fair to any man: 'All bloody buggers round this place' Once under the midday sun a golden wheel whirred by without stopping. Days without shade nights without stars even our mule avoided us. Aye it wis a dry and wersh old world and much rougher than litoral the sand in our shoes. They say poets sing. There's a lotta loose talk. I've seldom met one could even whistle \u2018Three Blind Mice'. Sing? there. Guess I came near to croaking, Dawn - cold - we stumbled through a fault in the desert, scunnered, dumfounert, disjaskit, boots shot, lips split, our stubborn mule the only optimist left (H.B. was long gone, 'less it were he) as we slid and clattered into that gully ... But halfway down, the ravine shrugged or the mule kinda changed its mind the way history does once in a while: a slash across the hillside glittered like a blade below it everything bled \n￼Green The mule shucked our baggage and ran. * Four faces, three human, one more or less, nose down In that water. Drank. Threw up. Drank more. Lay belly-down by cool waters. 'Un source,' Ken murmured, 'sprung straight from the dust, doubtless a glacier melt sent down to us by higher powers. This dawn is not my enemy's.' Water in our eyes, ears, hair, we stared at the terraces below stacked like plates, each with its garnish: almond in blossom, olives, figs, and the morning breeze like a perfect waiter to ask what we most wanted ... Between aridity and life a slash the width of an irrigation channel - miracle, for sure but one honed by human hands. 'Juxta S rinsed her hair from red to fair, knocked out her hat and spat, 'the whole armature of experience, the motor of modern art. If I had a hammer I'd knock up a sestina.' 'No, no!' they cried. She lay back, cracked her pursed lips, began to whistle. 'Sod that,' Axe said, lifted position,' said Stella as she shimmied up \n￼(the jewelled binoculars that hung from the neck of the mule: 'Woodsmoke, a village, water-mills, five hours hence. - Let's ro11.' * Up front she sang 'These Boots Are Made For Walking'. Behind her, Kenny ducked and hummed 'Halfway To Paradise'. She turned and looked at him and between them flew something like a pass who now held the ball, so quick I couldn't tell but something had been exchanged and happiness was punted way into the sky where it hung for hours descending slowly at dusk as we entered the village. Oh catch and wrap it in your arms and store it quietly in your pack like music for a better day. Then back to the Drylands. \n￼Meet1ngs in the Mill Two men rose like quivers of heat from the dried-up wadi, greeted us in Allah's name, demanded a light. We agree: God is good, shook on that. But the tall man's grip tightened on my wrist as he bent to light his cigarette and the short one drew a knife to pare his nails; in the glittering I saw the three who stood behind us. It's that simple: sun overhead, four blades, the oddly plastic black barrel of a semi-automatic stroked idly against the ribs. I wondered how this was going to feel, hoped it brief, especially for her whose fair hair shivered in the heat while the youngest plucked her necklace, swung it gently in his hand ... 'Well,' she said, 'no point giving up smoking now. Can I mouch one too, please?' 'Hal anta mai?' 'Whit's he sayin?' ( ''Whose side are you on?'' 'Ooh la la. Such ancient questions.' 'Hal anta Americain?' 'Je ne suis pas Americain, nous sommes des ficossais. (Hold on tight, babe.) Je n'ai pas fait cette guerre. (Christ, we should've stayed at your cousin's, the Archduke's.)' 'You speak very bad French. So, you are English, I think?' 'Pas du tout!' 'Alors, British.' 'Pas tellement. Scottish. Wee place up North.' \n￼The youngest man looked up. 'Scotland! 'Scottishers? Kenny Dalgleish! ' 'Oui, oui. Kent his faither. Uh, j'ai connu son pere ...' 'Ours too is a small country, our football team also loses. One day we shall win, Inshallah.' 'We are travellers, innocent travellers.' 'There's no such thing as an innocent tourist. You must know this.' The blade lay on my cheek, scraped: 'You need a shave, mon cher, you look like a terrorist.' - He laughed, flipped the blade high into the sky, it spun and whistled, whittling the breeze to nothing, and when it clattered at our feet all men had gone and we were alone in the wadi, sweat running from our boots. S 'Think ah've wet masel.' 'Nice knife, but not the one.' 'These bad dreams should not be in poetry but insert themselves like a shiv between the ribs.' We walked on, but from then the world was hotter, focusjbd, as if those men had been guardi ans lounging at the arch of an invisible lens and we had just passed through. Up ahead, distance and almond trees. We drank a little wine and came quickly to the village, pausing only every so often to be sick. \n￼A SIGNIFICANT MEETIIMG Three weeks into the High Atlas, rising each day- further into debatable lands where we could only guess the argument. Hard light, harsh land, honed faces with manners more courteous than ours, each with a knife winking at the hip and hospitality proportional to poverty as is the way with mountain people in this world as though their scabby villages are last undrowned fragments of an early world ... You won't like this thought, but there was a war on in a not so distant desert and we wondered whether chaos, like cruelty, is a constant that changes only its location and so will always find a home. I said you wouldn't like it. * We have gone behind, the war, Ken whispered, as though it were a curtain, a tapestry of violence, and now the heart draws back, revealing - A mule clicked down the canyon. On it an old &. humble man, relaxed, radio cradled to his ear. 'Labesse! Becher! How goes the war?\u2019 'As always. Did you. meet my son at the souk - has he sold goats? These damn Yankee batteries, so dear Vie sheltered in the shadow of the rocks. The war went on through tiny speakers, distorted, lost in that high stoney place, awful of course but not everything \n￼for we had seen the timeless village and now shared oranges & cigarettes with him: cool dry smoke sharp exploding juice dry smoke sharp juice all lifewas in thealternation desert war head-splitting heat silent afternoon this orange desire this Berber the end of desire these Christians rest in the mountains cool under the rock sputtering radio this cigarette and like a knife from its sheath, like a foot from its boot, came a slight easing ... 'Now tourists don't come to the shops don't buy from us when they can't sell to them, and thus we can't buy feed for the dry season. Sheep and goats starve alike. Hous savez, tourists like some birds are signs of peace and settled weather. 0 send down clouds, Allah! If we can't have peace or tourism, let us at least have rain. Though you have food, I see you're hungry. You have water, yet you thirst. I do not know your pilgrimage but I invite you to follow back to my village.' He rose and touched his hand first to his lips, then to his heart and we in clumsy fashion responded. He re-mounted and led us there, poor, assured, a distant war cradled to his ear. city, \n￼IN THE HIGHEST VILLAGE 'No,' we said gently, 'we do not want to come and see you 'make the folklore', no, nor take pictures of your daughters miming prettily in the fields. These travesties are painful, and must cease.' 'Wakha,' the old man grinned, stroked his lang neb. 'Agreed. So let's sit till the yellow rider slides down the saddle of the sky. (I'm expected to speak this way.)' mi npf ptsj/L* We sat down by a broken wall around a few untended trees in thin dry grass like clumps of hair clung to an aged skull. 'Peaceful here, we like it.' 'You've noticed, but are too polite to say. The terraces of the old ones are crumbling In empty palmeries the water channels return to sand. Now nothing here holds water long, the land returns to slow mode, half asleep, unkempt where once were dates and almonds, saffron, olives, wheat gleaned by goats.' 'My country too has empty hillsides, old walls crumbling by the sea.' t 'We did not call it ''folklore'1 then. We called it nothing but our way. Our festivals and funerals were enacted for no eyes but our own. There was no talk of ''the community'1 'My people were small tenant farmers not much impressed by anything but work and land. What's left from their labours? A way of standing, photogenic air. The land itself's a husk when no one is at home there.' 'Doubtless their sons built cities or went abroad. Who does not want words on the T shirt and new blue jeans \n￼made by the infidels he curses?' 'There was a cow, chickens, a bit land, a boat dragged high upon the machar. Their houses too were small and dark, full of smoke thick and familiar as fatigue and dignity. Doubtless their eyes watered.' 'My friend, you too have a peasant's mentality. I expect tourists then came from the South?' \u2018They did indeed. Left enchanted, wrote books about it.' 'Your women too are stubborn and short-legged, then flash a smile, making work worthwhile?' 'Don't let her hear you say that, but: yes. They know their worth, will not be messed with.' 'Our sons retire from the grocery trade in France and Spain, build European villas beside the ancestral cuddle of stones. I live in one with solar heating. It's very nice. At night the heat-pipes whisper my time is past.' \u2018Hard men, hard hands, hard minds, softened only in their eighties as they prepared to take their leave. When I was young we had two pear trees, a garden like this one. Grandfather, the saddler, gave me his penknife and wrapped his huge old hands round mine and taught me how to graft new ghoots to old trunks, make hybrids, and blossom slid from cAii\" shoulders as we talked.' 'Your hands, broad and coarse as mine, suggest you could work leather or the fieIds.1 'I can take a hint. What needs done?' 'Shokaran. This wall must be re-built against the goats. Also some hoe-ing, the highest channel shored again. May I allot your muscular friend, yourself, the unmarried woman. \n￼each to their suited task? Your patient mule can walk in circles, drawing water. 'Pal: you're on.' *** (That pointy hall of happiness you caught and snuck into your pack when you were searching, long ways from home, and lost, and found again, together with a handshake and an honest trade and eyes met for once across the barriers - be close now as remembered hills, the Alt a' Mhuilann, and Rest and Be Thankful.) \n￼We spent the war in that high corrie beyond all roads and radio, worked long days for Hadji, dossed down nights inside his byre, worked hard, slept well, content to shape another's garden. 'Sometimes salvation, like a worthy ox, cannot be yoked head-on' the old man grinned. 'Anyway, you're cheap labour while our young men are in the city or baking bread on the plains of war.' And Stella borrowed my penknife to scratch above the old man's mantle Sweat and sleep and in-between smoke and watch the moon awhile flattering the scraggy palms; may channelled water run each day, all night flow through your dreams. \n￼A Carry\u2014out: ep i sode So we're like beer bottles then, (the Grimpeur sighed one night), No deposit, no return? None answered. Axe groaned, for we knew by Ken's tone that we were in -fur £dr a fireside seminar of speculation from the thinker ... Yet nights like this below the stars (which do not waver at this altitude) make me finger the wildcard among the suits of possibility: Bud may be right. Play it: we're flittin from incarnation to carnation like busy dizzy bees layin up honey sweet or sour - in which case nothing is as it appears in which case Western Man's stoic premise and speedy ways are both completely fuckt in which case the bodies we mourn and bury are empty she11-cases and the bullet's lodged elsewhere in which case the people in the street have wings beating so fast we can't see 'em in which case my cat Spike (let us consider my cat Spike) isn't a nimble machine for consuming Whiskas any more than you and I are units of consumption in which case everything disappears but nothing ends in which case we had best mind what we chuck for it returns like a boomerang in one life or the next to get us in the neck and justice will be done not by a Judge but by an impersonal causal principle that can't be bribed or flattered by even the fattest of cats \n￼in which case everything is white as I once saw it on Princes Street all colours dabbed on by our eyes in which case we 1r,e investigating a mystery and the case id never closed in which case this same flower that blooms today tomorrow will bloom again when death's another name for pollination ... Yeah yeah yeah! Axe smashed a chord that rattled the termites in the Hadji's shed. Jings do I hate wishful thinking! Sure and the turtle people believe the universe rests on the back of a ... guess what? ... turtle. Sod it, we're all gonna die. Poet blew gently across the lip of a bottle of so-called Pale Ale and the sound dispersed among the saffron fields that lay around us. So what does the turtle rest on? she enquired. According to the hottest theorists, it's turtles all the way down. We fall silent, the last beer bottles clink. We.finish a cigarette, light another and stare into the night. Deep dark secret river, on either side ripe willows stir, the night breeze drifts like solar winds, bearing the invisible love-making of trees. (Still worrying about those turtles. I hope their shells are strong.) \n￼Brock took up the filthy oud our gaffer handed him one night, found it took his crippled fingers well. Raw Power (mind yon fret less bass?) lay wrapped in sacks, unplucked,- 'Nae use tae man nor beast, wi 'oot youth nor electricity' . Fast by the ingle, night by night slowly he acquired the trance-music of the gnawa that can drive out devils or drive insane. 'Hey we11, it's only ethnic radio, but it seems to cool my crazies.' Two Tuaregs appeared at dawn across the boundary of the village. Ancient, erect, near-black their faces, piercing blue their robes; one held a gimbri, the other banged a drum. Nothing was said, but they stared at Brock who glared back, but when they strode on up the mountain he bowed his head, picked up the oud, and with a sortof laugh set off in pursuit ... He returned days later, hirpling still, his left arm bent mair than before, but when he played next his fingers were quicker and precise in their pressure as acupuncture along the ear. 'Don't ask,' he said, 'just dinni speir.' And, later, 'Aye, dem ol' Arabian Blues, sure is strong magic. Yon power's no skin-deep. Nae need to be 19 nor leap across a stage tae prove it!' And Stella started to relax among the men, and women walked a little taller when she passed, and showed her how to do her hair and rim her pale blue eyes with kohl. And Stella said 'All truth is good news however dark it seems' \n￼And, later, 'Happiness is not my happiness' And she wrote less but her hands were steady. Ken's hands grew harder, but his mind moved less like metal, more like water. He said \u2018We got it wrong. The world is everything outside the text.' And, after a long day sharing the two-man saw among the pines, 'As a working hypothesis it's not entirely ridiculous to live as if another exists.' He became a favourite of the children for they found him not entirely ridiculous and he could make things disappear and re-appear, and tie most complex knots that pulled free with one tug on the end produced from his ear. \n￼o< *4 h:, A Munel icht Flittin < Homesick Speculation) It wis the dowp o a rare dreich & dowie day that left us hamesick all shagged out. Night, and the drizzle swayed away like someone/\u201cturned a watering can elsewhere. The moon rose bloody and pink. Axe coaxed a fire behind some rocks. We unwrapped our bedrolls in a Pictish ring. Ken cut a root and whittled a whistle to play 'The Northern Lights' very badly as at best of times it is, while Stella hunched and fed the fire with myrtle leaves/ to sweeten her thoughts when the world smelled bitter. 'Why do we linger here,' she said, 'so far from home? Does anyone see us in their mind's eye at all?' Brock shook his head, bent lower upon his oud, scrunching Django music from those strings. Ken heard his faither's tongue flicker through years of university training iIthrough sedimentary layers of reading, I travelling. Rock '^Roll, oh millions of words like tiny dead animals made chalk - like the outcrops around us that hard linguistic core persisted strangely in the moonlight when softer things had worn away. 'A munelicht flittin,' he breathed, and his speculation emerged in his faither's leid: 'Can anybody see us? I hae ma doots. Gin there be a God, yon great een canna keek through sae sma a crack in time as oors tae spy whit's gaun doon here! Yon Absolute is tae lang sichtit, and oor wee war Id's tae nearby j'/ JtS \u2019 for his kennin - believe me. \n￼we graipple here wi dreids and fairlies he canna even see.

We're on oor tod, or micht as well be. Above us, peers doon the Milky Way but the mune's a pale rider that canna dismount Whit the hell, my faither would say - It's whit ye dae when naebody's lookin that counts Ken folded his penknife. 'I've been a wanderer aa my life and mony's the sicht I've seen' he sang then mercifully lobbed the whistle into the fire, turned in for the night. Already Stella whiffled in her sleep, sweet bad dreams as usual .) And I lay staring at the stars, strung between my Company who tugged my brain this way and that, in their cradle the invisible cat as I tried to dree my weird. Ken's speculation though irrefutable and soundly Scots had left me low and feart ... Till Axe winked and strummed another number on his oud: 'But aa this doesni alter The orbit of Jupiter, Nor bring the sodger hame frae the Front. And if the sodger laid doun his arms, 'Sod this for a gemme o todies'. This would not alter the orbit of Saturn.
