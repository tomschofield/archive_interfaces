And the seal glides along the ceiling of ice, His shadow true, through a curtain of water. Water cast us on the wheel, water threw us together. And I will make you red , will pierce the sun To give you blood. First the hood forced from your head Then the plunge. And I will turn the snow to hot hot milk Shot from the nipple. Your origin in the wild wild sea. I will softly close the hole And blow a kiss. Cuckoo I am the cuckoo I grow bigger Uglier On the portions of myself You will allow Or The versions of yourselves You think I am. I am the bird You borrowed from a child. 11 0 ","docTitle":"","docDate":"1993-03-19"},"meta":{"contentType":"text/raw","emVer":"7.1.1103.5","langIdVer":"DefaultLangId","processingVer":"CalaisJob01","submissionDate":"2014-07-01 08:56:42.092","submitterCode":"57b17a53-6e34-87b0-20ff-a419896f49c9","signature":"digestalg-1|jnjiyDp5WIy+YPpGjG0qiPVl61I=|BhHUeGNLvvqT9kstgvMv9IPh1sFvBmgG/xMYHDPNZH3GkXjapPa8ng==","language":"English"}},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/d047cdc2-87a1-323c-8d95-befcba3f2d45/cat/1":{"_typeGroup":"topics","category":"http://d.opencalais.com/cat/Calais/HumanInterest","classifierName":"Calais","categoryName":"Human Interest","score":0.759},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/d047cdc2-87a1-323c-8d95-befcba3f2d45/lid/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http://d.opencalais.com/lid/DefaultLangId/English"},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/b6597b3e-311b-3937-8660-3a585e18d9be":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"Position","name":"correspondent","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/Position","instances":[{"detection":"[ or lovely thing exists in this world without its ]correspondent[ darkness. 9 \n￼Randall 9-36 19/3/93 11:02 pm Page]","prefix":" or lovely thing exists in this world without its ","exact":"correspondent","suffix":" darkness. 9 \n￼Randall 9-36 19/3/93 11:02 pm Page","offset":59,"length":13}],"relevance":0.596}}
