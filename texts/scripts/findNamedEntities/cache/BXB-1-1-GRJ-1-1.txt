And if his imagination pierces a tiny hole in these venerable walls and holds a candle through to a room full of wonderful things but utterly foreign to a decorously mounted hunting party with its fine equipage, its whips and sticks and stuccoed wooden courtesy - ^ ------------------ then what is that to us? Tally-ho! and on towards the twentieth century: let the boy be content with keeping trespassers from our noble pile; or immortalise our ailing Golden Retrievers. 10 \n￼Chorus of Newsmen W e are looking for a story. A running story, like the war. But not the war. An English story. Like Jack the Ripper. Like the Titanic. Like Scott of the Antarctic. W e miss the hot lead We used to catch. We miss those fat statistics That used to cover our front pages. W e can do nothing with this Latest dance, that latest creation. We are ready to jump into an aeroplane And leave for any part of the globe. (What is that Messenger carrying So swiftly from Dover?) We need a story. (Who is that recluse reminiscing Amid the cigar smoke?) We need a story. (And what is being unsealed? And why that smile? And whose are the words on that telegram?) W e are looking for a story For the aristocracy at breakfast, For the middle classes on the train, For the working-man on the street comer. (And why has the Editor of the Times Gone to Newbury Races?) Something to do with money. One story that is a total Eclipse of the sun and will last Until the next war. Something to do with death. (And why has the Earl of Carnarvon Cancelled all his engagements?) Something to do with mystery. \n￼W e are looking for a story That will set the peace ablaze. A story that is not a question. Not Irish. And not emancipated women. But which can be embroidered And photographed and sold. (Where is that young man hurrying With his notebook?) And not the civil war in China. (What is that noise in the telegraph wires?) And not the riots in Egypt. 12 \n￼1914 rThe landscape overhead will not be changed By flash-flood: it is a civilisation Bunkered securely in its desolation. More admirable, too, than this gold arranged About my sarcophagus - hanging its strange Treasures freely on view, a virgin cache Unnoticed by the lords whose liberation From dirty politics is a trench In the Kings\u2019 Valley. I warned them to keep Their distance from this entrance and its seal. Anubis is no god, but a dog asleep, So let him lie. Small punctures may heal Once you\u2019ve unmuzzled him; but not (that steep Descent over) your mad desire to steal.' \u2014 / 13 \n￼Theodore Davis\u2019s Last Season I have dug for treasure the way I smoke - without stopping, and obsessively. If I could have made my fortune like one Mr Standwood ofMaine, who imported mummies by the ton to turn into brown wrapping paper, then I would have saved myself twelve years of sweat. Or if I had been alive the century before him, I should have ground up the flesh and sold it to the poor at an immense profit. But no one today is after mummv-powder. If I surrender this choice concession, then that pariah dog Carnarvon will be down scratching where I\u2019ve been, although he knows I have already published Touatankhamanou. It\u2019s only this old seductress on my desk, this strange alluring figurine - and when I hear her boyish voice, \u2018the best is yet...\u2019 I should know it\u2019s time to quit: she has promised me into too many dark and secret hollows, whispering \u2018intact\u2019... I shall return to Florida, and make sure I die before she can call back: \u2018See? I promised!\u2019 14 \n￼I am waiting, like all the others, waiting To open the sacred seal and discover My future; and as I wait, this exhibition Snakes me through steel barriers to my golden Eighteenth year where I catch, amid the darkness That enfolds a teenage Pharaoh\u2019s history, Glimmerings of a more personal history, As if it had lain beneath the sand waiting For me to come and dig into its darkness In search of the famous Mask but discover Only in each glass case my own face, golden. It is my coming-of-age exhibition. All aspects of me are in this exhibition: The child\u2019sjhair and board-game are a history O f my early youth; my teens were that golden Dagger. This trumpet, this cow-bed are waiting For me to experiment, to discover In their cross-meshed passages of darkness, In sexual unity and divine darkness, The Goddess Hathor\u2019s milk-white exhibition O f her transfiguring powers: discover Between her lyriform horns all history. The Necklace of the Rising Sun is waiting To embrace us, its clasp is cool and golden... Each morning my hopes shoot greener, but golden Futures only bloom after months in darkness, During nights of counting the weeks of waiting, And now at this jubilee exhibition I am persuaded that time and history Are relative. Come, UCCA! and discover T o me the sacred light, let us discover The place where we are to spend our golden Prime and inscribe our names on history, As one young man did, emerging from darkness At eighteen to become this exhibition - The very thing for which we are all waiting. \n￼The Cedars at Highclere I see him in the distance. The stories he tells them waft across to me as I trim the lawns beneath his cedars. He loves cedars: his father asked my father to put them in. The Egyptians made all their tables and chairs out of cedar, he told me once, were buried surrounded by it. Now he\u2019s alone on that fancy verandah, reading, or glancing up towards these living crowns - always some fat volume open beside him. That\u2019s (he\u2019d say) since forty days stuck out in tropical seas with so little to do, between fighting off pirates and avoiding hurricanes, that he fell prey to the bookworm. But we know. In the old days he would never have stopped still long enough to have turned a leaf. If it wasn\u2019t the sea, it was the turf; if it wasn\u2019t the latest horseless carriage, it was some infernal air machine. Faster, always faster, until Trotman comes running to pluck him out from that blazing wreck in the Black Forest - head smashed, heart stopped. And all he wanted to know was had he killed anybody! Next thing, he is making Highclere a home for war-wounded, young lads cowering behind this shadow-line: muttering, wide-eyed ghost battalions. M \u2019lord was never one to let the grass grow. 16 \n￼Todav he showed us another of his latest photographs \u2014one of a mummified cat, which wasn\u2019t at all well received by his dog \u2014 nor by her Ladyship, for that matter. But then, we all have doubts about this digging up of times long gone. The papers make jokes about the thousands he has wasted (with 36,000 acres here to keep) and to my own thinking, when there\u2019s talk ofa curse you think twice. He\u2019s already had a good nine lives - chased by a wild elephant in South Africa (more of an achievement to have escaped than shot it, he said!), then only last week rushed to the hospital with three quarters of an hour to live. When he dies, it will be in a way nobody could have foreseen. \u2018I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve lost my nerve,\u2019 he whispered, straight after that accident. And he won\u2019t let anyone wrap him up in bandages. \u2018I want to be buried,\u2019 he laughs, \u2018out in the open, high up on Beacon Hill, then - if you like - \u2019 to us, he calls us his garden angels! - \u2018plant one of de Havilland\u2019s DH9s above me like a Pyramid; and make sure the grave is dug by a professional archaeologist!\u2019 Tomorrow he\u2019s off out to the East again. The last season, he has announced. \u2018If the Pharaoh^s don\u2019t bi^, the mosquitoes certainly will.\u2019 17 \n￼Entr\u2019acte Some friendships fell apart when they met our English damp. Some were too delicate to have been carried out of the past. Perhaps others will be reclaimed and restored. Two sentinels remain standing: Stuart, you were as watchful and all- seeing with your one eye as Ra, ever-forgiving when we forgot and threw the old washing-up sock for you to catch; breaking into your native Welsh in the souk, or kick-starting a rustic Arabic which you had patched up until it could drive a class of sixty to drill out, Tm-fine-thanks!\u2019 to your every \u2018How are you?\u2019 And how you hated that head  mistress of ours (whose name meant \u2018tin can\u2019, and whose face resembled one) for wagging a finger at you when you tried to \u201cborrow\u201d one of her clutch of Louis Quatorze to stock our chairless staff-room. You could bellow your own Son-et-Lumiere when you wanted to get things done your way; or simply sat with your shoe- soles turned insultingly on your victim. \u2018A fox!\u2019 as our idiom-proud Inspector of English chuckled. Yes - and a superb actor to that last 20 \n￼encore when you soliloquised draconian indignation before a baffled policeman. Scene: the Pyramids. Tofee0r Mot yp ^e arrested on vour last day in Egypt. Always making new friends and taking us on sightseeing marathons through backstreet dust-bowls and open sewers to try a glass of sugared tea and bassboussa - to meet Abdul Kareem, black and glistening on the desert\u2019s rim in a mud-brick storage-heater, whose latrine ran cockroaches, and whose library lacked only Volume Two ofLives ofthe Poets \u2014 to meet Mr Sami and his Violet, who fish-fed us and let us bloat on their privileged panorama of the Nile and Sadat being bulleted past, as they put in their requests for Macleans tooth  paste, Marks & Spencer shirts... then merrily bolted the door to show us the strength of their hospitality - Stuart, you tolerated it all, even when Alan popped up, dear utterlv-different-from-you old Alan, whose cracked earthenware humour could keep even his own temper cool. Who else would try to tell the joke about a whisky and a white horse called Eric to a room full of Moslem Brothers? Or endlessly repeat the story of how he slid down into that camel\u2019s ball-cracking jaws such that I can still smell its eunuch-making snorts today? Alan, we miss you falling off \n￼your bike, and holding forth on hieroglyphs and syntax and black kites, or blundering into arguments with jumped-up officialdom and market-sharks and little horrors and bigwigs and Jane. Even Jane (like the frogs who used to rev-rev as you sang) misses your crooning choruses - \u2018Beware of Long Lankin.. Beware all those unmarried girl students gazing at you from inside their Dalek costumes. \u2018Will you allow me to come in?\u2019 you made them repeat if they were late. Task-master! And Asmi, our old laundry man, he misses your Nile-smooth conversations up on that scorching roof above the domino slaps, sheesha fumes and warbling wailing cassette / drone of the cafe. And Ahmed, 2 our Professor of Physics, misses those searching debates about the possibility and necessity of classrooms, about the ultimate origin of our pay-packets... Alan and Stuart, you were two golden companions during our year of prospecting for poverty, and still you are - despite that a-hundred-and- twentv-degree day out when you had cycled on ahead up the white mountain to reach the Valley of the Kings well before us, unthinkingly bearing away the Greenings\u2019 unique and most precious yellow water bottle. 22 \n￼Water Boy Is the lad who breezes here on the sun\u2019s first ray, Who brings water to the men, who watches motionless The excavation mound while they ablute and pray, The genie who - civilisations ago - rolled a grey Pitcher above the Valley and watched it smash its torrent Down into the Place of Truth, sweeping away All entrances to the Old Kingdom? Because today That boy took a stick in his hand and, with motions Like a water-diviner, revealed where a king lay. \n￼The Picnic You\u2019ve not been down yet? Sir Arthur assures me it\u2019s nothing so very exciting. W e\u2019ve been here an hour, and all we\u2019ve seen is one ancient native carrying out something most unpleasant wrapped up in bandages. I\u2019ve been watching that odd young man who\u2019s blind or has some strange disability. You remember Victor, of course. Last year he took me to the Somme and we had a splendid picnic in one of the trenches - yes, they were my feelings too, absolutely - but we used an old ammunition box for a table and it was perfecdv civilised. Then the darling found me some pieces of an old shell of ours and had it made into a bracelet. Look at that brazen flapper powdering her nose! I do hope we manage to take home some little souvenir: Victor has asked Lord Allenby. You\u2019ll be at the rag-time ball? Or do you agree that there really are far too many Americans? Oh quite!

And when it fell open, why did your eyes take on that peculiar brightness as you saw (unexpectedly) a pair of little coffins side by side, head to foot, inscribed \u2018Osiris\u2019, with no other name; and in each coffin a tinier one, of gold, containing two unborn and unidentified babies, mummified and motherless, one in a burial mask pathetically huge for its age? Are these the children that you did not have, that you could not permit into your life, \u2018too busy with scientific work\u2019, cataloguing your Pharaoh\u2019s collection of games and toys, or trying to purloin that lotus head, cute and irresistible as a first-born? \n￼Visit of the Egyptian Antiquities Department\u2019s Inventory Commission Each item labelled and in its own place.

I used to get their catalogue sent and crept nightly into the treasury: fans, flowers, Floating Zombies, Find the Lady, Funny Bunny, Indian Rope-trick, Chinese Rings - and on the back page all I could afford, the after-dinner jokes - a blue plastic coffin with a red plastic \u2018King Tut\u2019lying quite snugly, held by a concealed magnet, which, with a sleight of hand, you could dislodge so that like-poles repelled and the Pharaoh would not lie down, would not lie down, only you the arrogant thirteen-year-old knew how! I was a regular mummy\u2019s curse from the day I found King Tut. \n￼For My Father M arch, 1923: now the sealed door Is opened in the Valley of the Tombs O f the Kings; and in Chiswick, you are born - Not to a blaze of flash photography, But crawling the width of a no-m an\u2019s-land Between two wars. Nor will you be brought up Like a,/Ktng, but by the time you are eighteen Know the riches of possessing a bike And wireless. No time for ancient history! When you join up, you are delivered into A modern, disarmingly n^ve land, So new it still bubbles. In Akureyri, Your headset is picking up hieroglyphs, But nothing, no greeting, from The Black Land Or Living-Image-of-the-Hidden-One, That eighteen-year-old with whom you share A birthday; and it will be forty years Before you feel you can make contact with Your contemporary. But by the time We were pedalling into El Gurnah (famous For its bandits) past squatting black covens O f women, their sons like huge weathered masts W hite lateen-sailed, your 7 a.m. breakfast Had risen to 12 noon, and we panicked Because of your diabetes. Semi- Conscious, slumped there beside a drainage ditch In a field of sugar, the sugar-carts Swishing past, tij&K unrefined wallads flicking The flies away and chewing lengths of cane, You had regressed to the nineteen-twenties: When (from that tomb-robbing Gumah clan) down Came a stranger, who climbed out of his taxi And silently removed you to his house, No rock chamber in the foothills, no cache O f M iddle Kingdom murals, but a simple White-washed tunnel-vaulted house of mud brick There on the fertile plain.

He understands that the man possessing a lion\u2019s heart must own all other parts appropriate to a lion, and that I do not hunger only after the cold sepulchre ofJerusalem, but worship each of these warm gifts he has sent to me, their flesh so maddeningly sweet that my physicians advise me I should not indulge. Yes I am sick - but sickness is all I have ever enjoyed ■^ince first I leant crookedly on my pilgrim staff \n￼and felt it snap under me, or since the night came muttering how the King should put away all unlawful deeds and beware the Fate of Sodom.

So long as he had to keep dismounting for a squat, we\u2019d not lose track of him, although the Fens kept trying to draw a mist between us as we were hauling his baggage-train from King\u2019s Lynn through Wisbech towards the Wellstream. But then, at the Estuary, the air became as clear as that cut topaz Pope Innocent gave to him, and at once we knew that his sickness had lifted along with the autumnal murk. He breathed, looked north, and said not a word (not even: were his treasures all secure, his crosses, his cups, his pearl-studded knife?) and cracking another raw egg, beckoned us on into the landscape\u2019s open mouth. We heard the quicksand smacking its lips, and the tide-rip\u2019s slobber; but he w'as away off on the scent of cider, swallowing his eggs whole, like a skua-gull. O f the one hundred and forty-three cups of white silver we have now empded into the darkening W ash, of the gold plates, and of the crowns that have sunk like flatfish, \n￼had he observed but one, or seen us attack the thick cords binding his precious collection of baths, valuing only - among the emeralds and sapphires of the advancing tide - a few more seconds gained, and up to our waists and feeling the rear axle lurch, had he but noticed our desperate tableau, these fingers clutching the setting shafts of his last pageant-cart, and felt not hunger, not parricidal anger... But King John is in Swineshead now, exultant no doubt, and panting praises at his deliverance from the gut-ache, enjoying a ripe peach, the first of the new cider, assuming that one of his servants will be on hand to bring him the crown jewels to finger, and his favourite bath, with kingly quantities of healing water from the W ellstream. \n￼Edward I He had been playing chess. With whom? Toom Tabard, perhaps - King Nobody! But he had got up to pace the room, when from that shadowy and uncharted area above him, from that high vaulting, a clan of ancestral granite came humbling down on to his chair. He had been about to declare the game a stalemate. But instead, he swept north to Dunbar and the Palace of Scone: there claimed, in case it should one day fall and crush the English throne, the stone that was a nation\u2019s destiny. \n￼Edward II ft was to Berkeley Castle that they brought Him after that had beaten him, hoping to Starve him, and when he wouldn\u2019t be starved, Inserted into his rectum a red- I Hot, specially procured, ox-roasting \\ ' Spit, that his body should not bear any mark.

But all the kings\u2019 sons are either stuck fast Or outside still hoping the barrier will break. 6 A six-stone, four-foot bird that never sings, That swims like a porpoise and dresses Like an impresario; whose prehistoric predecessors Had scaly claws, himself waving feathered wings He\u2019s never been known to use... that\u2019s the one We\u2019re here to collect: the Antarctic Emperor. It lays its eggs on bare ice just in the windiest corner As the winter sets in. Everyone else has gone, Except this foolhardy creature. And the egg It enthrones between its belly and its feet, Bill assures us, is packed with scientific meat, So it\u2019s well worth this few weeks\u2019 slog - Difficult though it makes it to distinguish The Emperors\u2019 foolhardiness from that of the English! \n￼7 Ambassadors of \u2018the Empire on which the sun Etcetera\u2019 where the sun won\u2019t even rise! There were stars. We had the moon. The aurora At times. But most, the wind cracked its blunder- Buss of blizzards and knocked all the lights Out of the sky. It was the darkness, more Than the cold. Bill\u2019s Time to get up! Birdie\u2019s groan. Cherry trying to get some use out of his eyes. When we were bumping through the lower slopes ofTerror Our heels bruised by the sledges as we sped down Into the complete black, once the cloud broke, and the sky Signalled three steps ahead with an ice-mirror. It flashed about a crevasse. W e\u2019d been shown The trap this time. Perhaps we were not alone. 8 AM GOING SOUTH AMUNDSEN What if he tried? W e think of Scott and all the others wintering at the Base. (Shall we go on? Yes, yes! they replied.) Whether or not we do go, he must decide: If Scott decides we don\u2019t go, England loses face. AVI GOING SOUTH AMUNDSEN Would he have lied? And back home, commiseration, criticism, wide Publicity of our abandoned mission, failure, disgrace... (Shall we go on? Yes, yes! they replied.) But if we went we\u2019d have the ranks of England\u2019s pride To defend us! Ifwe went, and ifwe won that race... AM GOING SOUTH AMUNDSEN W hat if he tried? (Shall we go on? Yes, yes! they replied.) If we don\u2019t go we\u2019ll wish we had gone even though we died. 66 \n￼9 To howl. A fit of shivering. Your flame gutters/ At a hundred and ten degrees of frost you feeD Each fresh drop as a fresh turn on the wheel O f the rack. Like lock-jaw, your body chatters Till a dream has at last solidified: of your mother\u2019s Arms and of Papa\u2019s bookcase, of cook\u2019s hot meals, Of a girl, of girls - But now the Killer Whale\u2019s Black nose has broken the floe. It scatters The fantasy. To howl! It\u2019s the ice has seized You through your bag, has snatched the dream You hugged between your belly and your feet And smashed it. Left you, a foetus, to freeze. Cherry yawns. Birdie snores. And Bill calls Time - To howl? To die? To get up and eat. 10 A blindfold and a flash of white and you drop Down down down (oh dear I shall be late) a jerk! Stiff. You must be dead. My watch, where - ? I expect That pink-eved white angora rabbit hopping Away along the blue-glazed corridor there.. .All right? There\u2019s a jar marked \u2018orange marmalade\u2019, I\u2019ll just - I said areyou all right? Fine, but first I must Just taste this - did you see it? The white - the white... The crevasse is dark and deep. You can\u2019t express The pressure of your confused faults, only hang stiff Like the hanged man. There is no handhold Word, only the rope. You are within the question Which has no answer. You must let them lift You, curiouser and curiouser, back up to the blindfold. 67 \n￼11 They swing, they sway, silk curtaining, they flash like swords Or searchlights, lemon, orange, green, Whirling in the east. We lay back our heads And gazed. Exhausted. Incapable of words. Wagner. Drury Lane. The kinema. An underground train\u2019s Electric flash. Incandescent flickering leads Opening through the dark. Distant power-lines At minus fifty. Ice-angels dancing. Will-o\u2019-the-waste Luring us. The ghosts of the other dead explorers. We gazed. We were transfixed. Except near-sighted Cherry, whose lenses were so utterly iced Up he missed the show! But wasn Vit so boring Stuck out there| Deprived o f everything Society Can offer? The bright lights! Didn'tyou get depressed? 12 Not a snow petrel. Not an albatross or skua. Nothing in the bare sky ahead but frost. Might there Perhaps be apenguin? Or are we the three sole survivors ofawar. Something out ofWells. On Mars. Or in somebody else\u2019s nightmare. At home, in the warm, what\u2019s a friend? Someone to drink with, to joke with. On this trek, That privilege is all you have between your mind And the ice. He is the Emperor. You are his egg. If one of us had faltered, he could have cracked The rest of us. So there was no argument. At worst, \u2018W e reached bedrock\u2019 and crawled into our bags With a dull groan. The weather was all we cursed. Then laughter. Songs. Obscure faith. And selflessness. Bill. Birdie. Cherry. Words could not express... / 68 \n￼13 Just how utterly exhausted we were, Until we brought the second sledge when our own prints Came to seem like humps we had to lift Each foot across. Even the \u2018W interreise\u2019 Tunes freeze, but feet can\u2019t stop. Your harnesses Are bar-lines. The blizzard plays you on. And though your lips are solid, and your heart-beat\u2019s Too slow, you sing, anything, but it must get you there! Ein Licht tanztfreundlich before me. I\u2019ll follow, even though it wants to lure me To the graveyard with Schubert and Wilhelm Muller. When you\u2019re musically hollow, you surrender yourself T o any gaudy beat. Hinter Eis und Nacht und Gratis There is a helles, marmes Haus. All I desire is delusion. 14 Antarctica House, its windows are whirls O f bleariness, its furniture is draped white, The rooms one long chill draught of dark Closed doors. Occasionally, a sheet unfurls A stony sheen, or the leads in the tracery light With a stained aurora, only to sink back to the stark Domain of silverware, cut glass, and engraved Mirrors huge as mountain corries. All the clocks Have stopped, their rotating suns permanently down. All the beds, though invitingly smoothed, Are cold, unoccupied. And each of the household nooks, That flaw with a spider, a beetle, or a mouse... Even the servants have gone. Then who was it passed Us in the butler\u2019s pantry, that tail-coated ghost? \n￼15 Tea from wickerwork in a Mallows or a Mawson garden. With the ladies in Brighton luxury or on a Bexhill beach. U nder the Sunningdale pines in a deevie Ford T , With golf-clubs. On two wheels strumming a ukelele. Out at a hop. Or at Hove, watching Alletson\u2019s Brief heatwave. On rollerskates down the prom. And at dusk, Magic lanterns, moonlit menus, Gipsy Love, the Machiche, the Galop, Or a dip, with the ladies. The love beneath the stars. The leaving cards. Smell of melting wax and strawberries, sound O f champagne and Caruso. Punt-pole sticking. Straw hat Floats down to Parson\u2019s Pleasure, with the ladies, M auve and green in the prolonged light, Che gelida manina, That divine, liberty-steeped, easy, golden July Nineteen-eleven. This rigor. This winter of aJuly of nineteen-eleven. 16 When Houdini challenges them to bind him head to foot, Fetter him, snap handcuffs on him under six stout locks, Then have him screwed into, riveted into a plate-glass box Filled with water, which is then itself closed in; or put Into a strait-jacket, wrapped in thick canvas with straps O f hide and steel buckles, and requests to be hung upside down From a crane off the top floor of the highest block in town So he can demonstrate again the ingenuity of his escapes... There seems to be little to distinguish us. We volunteered To be thrown into this dark. Asked to be snow-stocked, frost- Manacle^, strapped in harnesses, immobilised. W e chose to battle against the clock for dear life, just to be cheered And called a hero. And we, like Houdini, boasted W e could escape even frozen in a solid block of ice. 70 \n￼29 \u2018Steadfastly, surely,\u2019 said the Express Correspondent, Its twenty thousand tons of nothing slid \u2018Like some movement of Fate... as a glacier glides To the sea\u2019...Steel bauble, diversion for the affluent, A jerry-built toy! From the White Star, Bruce Ismay Is standing proud and smiling in the dock. Twenty-two knots, yes sir! he assures us. Nearer New York To Thee. Blue Riband in his eyes, a smile. We are still at Crozier, listening to the wind rivet Its Ross Sea Dreadnought, Unsinkable, To be sent north next^ring, parade tiptoe In front of millionaires and aristocrats who\u2019ll have it Photographed and still not picture the unthinkable, The cold, the dark, the seven eighths below. 30 I\u2019m awake at the crack, but not of dawn. Once I woke To hear the same noise, in February - ponies at the oats, I thought. Dark then, too. A thin mist. Then this vague rocking, And, gradually, the long black tongues poking out of the floes (had) As far as the eye \u2014and Guts hajp gone! The rest we had to make N----y Jum p, before they\u2019d drifted or slipped off and were swallowed Into those hideous jaw-crevasses. Again now the creak. It freezes me in soaked sweat, the heaving groans O f the pressure-ridge. You expect at any moment the bilious Motion, the black openings to be licking the split pack, Your gear sunk, your tent stranded, the corvine killers Sidling under you...Then the cold coughs: it\u2019s winter, relax. Today you only have to manhaul two huge loads Through the pitch dark, across concealed crevasses, towards 77 \n￼31 Another time, when there was a lake here, warm With fish-life, palms round it, emerging species Struggling out, and before that, before the slopes of beech And conifer, before the snail even, before the worm, In earliest Jurassic, when the earth\u2019s womb Was trailing afterbirth and the red screech Which was life had wriggled, unloved, unleashing Its wild schemes to expand and overwhelm Its feverish, exhausted mama - im agine... And in a couple of million centuries\u2019 time, Us, sitting in our tent atop that blue shining M ile-deep history of heat and raging Blizzards, chafing dead limbs at a primus, On the point of succumbing to evolution. 32 We are caricatures who box between the slits In the spinning rim of a toy. We are spun To re-enactment on this wheel, for the fun O f experiencing continual defeat. Among the exhibits In the Crystal Palace, beneath the curving lights With organ and wind-machine, in wax: Birdie, Cherry, and Bill. The tableau, Victorian Murderers Is next to ours, Edwardian Suicides. There is no getting away, there\u2019s little hope O f ever getting out of this. It was a hazardous Undertaking. Not heroes, three foolish men. We are small figures in a crystal globe T urned upside down and shaken to a blizzard By a child, who laughs, and shakes it again. 78 \n￼33 \u2018A stranger I came out here, a stranger I go back\u2019 The summer months amused us. We watched the sea-ice crack. The papers spoke of heroes. Our leader of the Pole. But now we feel these ice-jaws devour our very soul. It\u2019s every day and all day, or else our fuel won\u2019t last. In darkness, minus seventy, we haul against the blast. The moon and cloud in conference allot a gleam or two. A glimpse of guttering footholds, black smudges in the blue. For God\u2019s sake why put up with this? It\u2019s going to drive us mad. Those penguin cries will haunt us. Their eggs will all be bad. My blank thoughts are irregular. My breath has turned to rhyme. I\u2019ll close my verse behind me, and I may be out some time. Have cut a final ditty for the public as I walked. A valedictory spiral. T o be sung the way I talked. 34 Glockenspiel, wind-machine, and wordless chorus. Closer, shuddering the diaphragm, closer time cuts The groove, records our Sinfonia Heroica. Glockenspiel, wind-machine, and wordless chorus. Icicles of string begin the lament in A minor. We are beneath the knife, we can feel this Cancer cut from our throats, we have seen into the abyss. Icicles of string begin the lament in A minor. A Christian soul from deep within the ice-fall Summons us. Absurd, our hurdy-gurdy Tune grinds on: aufdem Eise Wankt er hin und her Go forth upon thy journey Christian soul, from deep within the ice-fall, und sein kleiner Teller bleibt ihn immer leerf\u2014 ^ m/( 79 \n￼35 All is well. I shall simply \u2014I have no regret \u2014 I shall simply fall and go to sleep in the snow - Except in leaving you to struggle through alone \u2014 Mere faith, mere absolute faith that even that Is all for the best. I\u2019d like to have seen your latest letters. Dad\u2019s little compass and Mother\u2019s little comb Are in my pocket. I had wanted to send news home But we\u2019ll all meet after death, death, death is All is well. We have struggled to the end. What matters We have done what we thought was best. My own Dear wife, goodbye, God be warm to you, blow Kiss, wind, crack, and a cheer from Cherry: the hut is Straight ahead. Then have I slept twice sixty-seven miles? Or Heaven is a hut, hot cocoa, familiar smiles. 36 One day in nineteen-ten I had a fleeting vision. I saw in imagination a solemn pagan rite, Sage elders seated in a circle watching Young men march themselves to death. One day in nineteen-eleven it was dark And I heard Corinthians read, and an arrangement Of St Matthew played to a Coronation .March, My friends pictured in tombs within W estminster. One day after nineteen-twelve has passed, The pressure to obey one steadfast finger Will have crushed my craving for the solitary wastes Into a pungent relish for adventure O f any sort, so off to a trench in Flanders.

Today, she sorts through The seed-packets, extravagant annuals We always, in the past, shunned in favour of Some slow-growing, undemonstrative shrub. I stake the tree. All set for the next gale. Its branches wear no hint as to whether There\u2019s life within. Three hammer blows And she calls, \u2018I\u2019m off to my appointment!\u2019 The blossom is in her face. And her words - She grips their meaning - cut with a cold edge. 82 \n￼The London Plane A frost rang early with the results: Cling, now, to your life\u2019s short year, for each O f its yellowing days m ust let the five senses Twist, then drop, until you are naked asleep. Awake - patched, yet with hardly a wrinkle - You stretch and bend to shade the truth from us, But must submit, an ashen almost-skeleton, To be avenued in soot-free, showerless white, Falling in with these others, octogenarians also - Survivors of the repeated ^pring raids, Hawkers of a century\u2019s detritus, Londoners - Londoners to your lacewood core! Allow, gradually, the soft expansion from beneath That rigid bark to shuck whatever poverty Or close-grained prejudice could not resist. Hug your next year\u2019s buds. Accept And protect the swelling in the hollow stem O f each hour, each last breath, until the day falls. \n￼Walnuts She would plant two saplings. There would be silence from the burial place, but in the future, each Christmas, home-grown walnuts. As if a word picked green had then gone sour, she flinched - these family crackings the exposed ends of a nerve-tree. A husnand deep in the pickling jar. Two daughters coolly hooking brain from skull. A father and a mother trying to split their wrinkled shells. There would be silence. There would be years of fruitlessness. She would plant two walnuts. \n￼The Ash the Ash is for you because of its charcoal buds because it conceals white magic because it can hold all winter creation\u2019s keys because it is tough because as a spear, a hoop, a chess-set, a picture-frame, or a stage brace it will keep its elasticity because it can make its own face up first appearing with ruddy mountain cheeks then in pale chorus weeping through Twickenham gardens then the scarred and grizzled hero of some grey Norse epic collapsing to a sudden curtain because it is like a chameleon an old Polonius because it can smile heal advertise mesmerise and tell tall stories because it was once Yggdrasil because it is the last of the species in our end game Jack, the Ash is for you 87 \n￼Sweet Chestnut Maturity is to know the star-shakes in your heart. It is to have turned aside and, despite the upright and the smooth, gone on turning. It is to be twisting free of one\u2019s roots, ascending to its very lip the twin helix. T o have observed each year some fresh disfiguring lump. To have felt the next ring splitting under the renewed weight of spring. It is to have seen the spears lifted, then a spiked mace. On slopes of ash to have faced the eruption of your griefs. T o have flowered. T o propagate. / 88 l t \n￼Loveliest of Trees (for Katie: b. 16 May 1986) Cherry Ward in mid-Mav - one waste corner of our lives is suddenly in blossom and we are laden with this puckered and purple fruit, a basketful of sweet Katie, bitterly loved by us, and by the birds.

But the complexions Are no less smooth, the trunks, the rigidity O f salute, proclaim no less their mastery. Those dead - how can you shake them off? Not here, M arching the ABC of a beechwood trail. In the picnic areas, the birds still Sing 'Horst Wessel\u2019. The soft insignia Of the beech-nut is still cast into spiked VW\u2019s, row upon row of steel bonnets. Nor have the altar carvings (the swastika, Heart, or star) grown out; but have become sealed Into boles huge as cathedral buttresses. Not even the annual Landschaftswunder, Printing a Spring, manufacturing a youth, Can quite dislodge that crumpled rattle O f Billionmarkscheine.

I comfort her with talk Appropriate to her three months of light, Sweet nothings such as King Lear perhaps once spoke T o his beloved fool, before the night Tunnelled his wits. Still she will not setde. I would have tried to lull her with that long Blank verse speech of Edgar\u2019s if I thought beede, Chough, or crow talked peace. But she wants a song, So: \u2018There\u2019ll be bluebirds over...\u2019 Searchlights sweep Above these black white cliffs, and she\u2019s asleep. Borders We cross borders, and don\u2019t even get out Our passports now, as if these mapped frontiers Were a well-healed scar: after all, it\u2019s years Since there was anything to fight about In Europe - brownshirts, the uniformed lout Who looked you in the eye until your tears Ran cold, these are gone; here, nofone disappears Except to snatch a wurst and sauerkraut In the fnot<\/rway[cafe. Yet ifyou\u2019ve read Or heard tales, or seen newsreels of the war, You will want to know the faces of those who Crossed this line before you and are dead, Who were startled by an early knock at the door, Or picked out from some shuffling exit queue. \n￼Chagall Windows (Mainz) Chagall, the ninety-year-old, from deep shades O f love, transfiguring the Scriptures to a blue Glass covenant, that Gentile might live with Jew, Paints unaware of the post-war parade Outside St Stephan\u2019s, where retired ladies And gentlemen of Mainz patiently queue In front of a plate-glass shop-front for new Special offers, and do not seem afraid O f sudden reflections; of Kristallnacht Winking at them; of a myriad store- Windows smashed in hatred; of glimpsing back through That stark proscenium to the final act...

But it\u2019s too late now - The streams have broken the wooden bridges And the woman without a face is sleeping Nude in your hotel bed again, the view Exactly as you desired: cold ridges O f consummation, and the guilt creeping Too slowly to be seen, but towards you. V erdun Needles have put these battle-wounded hills Into a deep sleep: innumerable shots O f darkness have calmed the nightmares that wailed Through this landscape by day. Conifer roots Do not need topsoil, will conceal flesh and bones, And grow so quickly their branches can catch a phrase From music-hall and conceal it until it keens Like a low wind. Conifers can erase Almost everything - warm limbs or cold steel, Craters, corpses, barbed-wire, a rusted machine- Gun, a head, a heart, an unexploded shell - Almost everything, to a profound green, While the fruits that have kept these comatose hills Alive, drop in handfuls like sleeping pills. 94 / \n￼The English Dream The English dream of nothing as grimy As a coal-mine, but of a filigree past, Nothing as real as a steel industry - They would prefer to do without the last Two hundred years and live in a century They imagine to have been, where good taste Was a knot garden, not a chip factory. Revolutions can change too much too fast... So we sit, and we soak up glossy brochures Touching the gilded realms of William Morris; In easy chairs hand-wrought from English oak, Leafing through woods and streams and air as pure As celluloid, where shepherds woo Chloris With ingenious rhymes, and there\u2019s no work. Repatriation (December 1989) We who have withstood raids by dragon-boats And cowered in thatched mud camps while a fire-storm Flayed our perimeter fence - seen our warm Fleeces bled, drinking-holes spiked, ash threshed from oats. We who once clung, through years of salt, to remote Salvages and a dream of syrup trees, And learnt, at the first breaker, refugees Should never dream...Who took the strain when notes From expeditionary gulls gybed our throats To a raw haven, without homes or work, No new world, but a crossing from Dunkirk In open pleasure cruisers...We who loved boats Must now push these people into the air! Who will rescue us from our raft of votes? \n￼John Greening was born in 1954 and brought up in Hounslow on the outskirts ofLondon.
