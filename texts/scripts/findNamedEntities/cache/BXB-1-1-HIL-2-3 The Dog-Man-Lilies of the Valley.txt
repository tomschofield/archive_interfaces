Her eyes are glazed., and her face could be basked on by lizards it's so still. She's mistress of the art of frozenness, hiding at the side of herself like a pilgrim bathing in the Ganges being cruised past by loudspeaker-toting boats; like a diseased tomato; like a brain-damaged child, strapped in a van who's watching,or anyway parked in front of, an open-air,wrap-around,drive-in, completely incomprehensible picture-show, and the van has a sliding door that might accidentally slither open any minute and send a whole avalanche of untouchable things that have no business to be there, / and should nevex\\be seen, tumbling out into the open like mutes or brains; and. at night;, when r'in nearly asleep, I sometimes come across her - \u2022vicious,hunched^up-and-incapacitated, \u2022 still hugging her hairless awkward little thighs. \n￼MY FIRST BRA A big brown bear is knocking at the door: he wants to borrow a dress and matching knickers. The smell of lilac smothers me like wool; beyond the lawns, I hear my naked sister crying in the nettles where I threw her: nobody else is having my first bra. \n￼1 warnSELIMA HILL 5 S The Villa i 9 His famous cock 10 that he goes on about\u2019s 11 about as much fun 12 as a frozen lamb, 13 and I just ran away 14 across the heath 15 one night; 16 I left the moonlit villa 17 far behind, 18 the helicopters, chainsaws, 19 parrots, knives, 20 and little maids who specialize 21 (he gives them sweets) 22 in screaming 23 at the parrots; 24 I slipped away, 25 and came back 26 here, 27 to you: 28 breathing gently 29 like a giant flower 30 smelling of custard 31 being stirred, 32 and licked - 33 custard 34 madeofeggs 35 and warm vanilla pods, 36 where egg-white isles 37 float 38 to Paradise. 1 2 3 1 I \n￼SELIMA HILL Lilies of the Valley The flying-helmet my late father wore smells of seals, cloud-banks, German blood. I stand in silence, shouldering a broom. At night I draw huge maps in the mud. We live in woods, beside a quivering fire, tattooing Ban the Bomb signs on our thighs. We wrap ourselves in clouds like sleeping moons. We'll sing our songs together till we die. * We stay indoors. We dye our jeans and hair. We sew black lace round everything we wear. We soak our feet in bowls of turpentine. Our knickers twinkle like a diamond mine. * Office-workers watch us from their windows coil like a snake around the square. NAGASAKI SMELT OF BURNING PIGS. Hush, he wants to sink his lips into my hair . . . * Tea-coloured soup pervades the Infant school. The boy I want to sleep with's disappeared. The one I'm being kissed by looks like Jesus - His smile, His flowers, His pale ginger beard . . . * As soon as I walk in, my mother knows. She throws away my banners and my jeans. I said I'll march for everfor this garden, this lily-of-lhe-valley, this white rose. * I'm dancing on the air-base with Teresa. Her father will be furious. She is blind. * Beneath the planes, beside the muddy river, we're waiting for the march to move again. Lost children. Sheena Easton quietly singing. Three vicars mend a Trident in the rain. * I've got little ones myself, the airman said, his uniform as cold and metallic as lilies-of-the-valley; panic; tin. ♦ I live on bread the nurses leave in bowls, while in my dreams the bullets turn to bees: I feel the sunshine rub against my thighs, the drip drip drip of honey in the trees.
