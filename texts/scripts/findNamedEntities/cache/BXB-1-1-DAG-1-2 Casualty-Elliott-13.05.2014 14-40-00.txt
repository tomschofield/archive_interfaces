All day I wondered where I was in a house I part-owned; fell into a trap trying to fit a small cupboard in  to a large one, succeeded, though it ate up all my time. However hard I tried to make it pretty, it was still one cupboard forced by a one- track mind into another. Morning slid into midday. I guessed by the way light dulled in cornerless shadows as cloud massed stewing up something. If there was a sun to tell the time by I wouldn\u2019t know how. Was it there at the start? Had she returned in one piece, though confined to our hard bed, I\u2019d have found a way round things; left those two cupboards alone. The ambulance will bring her back to me and our settee sure to resume its function, no longer resembling a coffin she\u2019d straighten moments before her collapse in front of me when the look on her face, directed at those two cupboards, cut right through me and beyond. I took it to mean I should do something about them to cement her return, when you came in, remember? \n￼EVERYTHING They know where our pipes run below the city; narrow bores abandoned to silt; plans to huge, polished, sunned cockroaches, pretty permanent and in love with silk. We\u2019re back to level steps- the spill of buckets mapping our journeys from standpipes; to coffins dumped on tips. We hear how dawn breaks; how cathedrals shrink with frostbite: under an even frost not just thrown but spread worldwide as if with a trowel. Taxis with headlights off knock people down dead stopping to clear their paths, towel blood from a cracked windscreen, straighten a bumper, or castigate a live victim. They pull away with screams and leave burnt rubber, hitting the road hard for custom. \n￼SEA CHANTEY This ship on this sea like my sweetheart and me: Left and right, up and down, round and round. Be still, I told her, when lying on mined ground; More still or you\u2019ll trigger the detonator; Absolutely still before I fall off the world; Please steady your breathing or I am history. All the while I\u2019m begging, she\u2019s answering, Man, something sweet, some thing bigger than us Combined, pulls and pushes me so I can\u2019t hold on; I\u2019m harnessed to two stallions powering Left and right, up and down, round and round. This ship on this sea like my sweetheart and me. So she moved. So slow, moving without moving, You couldn\u2019t see her hips\u2019 sway; a slowness Gathering itself; picking up, picking up quick. Then she bucked and I bucked and we exploded: This ship on this sea like my sweetheart and me, Left and right, up and down, round and round. \n￼ARRIVAL -1- I left my village and my village girl, for a town my age which is no age at all. I am stirring pepper in a Pepperpot: her promises for Casrep; her promises for stock. -2- You see me gripping my felt hat, The cold squeezed me so, My head no longer filled it. Customs rattled me to my bones, My teeth opened fire with blanks From my sea-soured breath. Just when I thought salt Had seized me up I started belching. I belched at everyone who came up to me. I belched through my apologies, And apologised through my belches, Thinking, this must be Belchertown, not England. / \n￼A RIVAL Four men in darkness Check if I conceal a tail- I am swinging low. \n￼A Dream of Fatherhood My sons float into and out of an airless room I keep books in or I\u2019m kept in by books. They\u2019re covered in powder or flour or chalk, I can\u2019t tell since all textures are the same and everything smells of nothing or I can\u2019t smell. Cameron and Elliott, I say in my stern voice, Don\u2019t be in and out; either you stay and sit with me or play in another part of the house. They appear to listen but drift in and out again. \n￼CAMERON Your arms and legs squeeze me when I pick you up, resting your head on my left shoulder, then on my right. You eye me over with searching nods, as if to confirm it\u2019s really me, while you change your head-rest. When I put you down at last, all the places where you were ache with removal, like the limb patently not there, that an amputee feels when a cold spell\u2019s about to come on and then miraculously does come on. \n￼ELLIOTT Bones as small and thin as yours need a protective case round them. You run the length of a corridor on a matchstick frame to greet us. You fall forward with pidgeon steps, I scoop you up in time, my grip loose as if I\u2019d cupped a wasp and firm against any notion that you\u2019d be dropped by me: my son while hospital machinery circled a lump in your bladder you cried at us and peed on us.
