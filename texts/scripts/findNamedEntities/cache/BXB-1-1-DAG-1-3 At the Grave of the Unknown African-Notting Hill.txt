Those cherubs with puffed cheeks, as if chewing gum, signal how you got here and where you came from. More than two and a half centuries after your death, the barefaced fact that you\u2019re unnamed feels like defeat. I got here via White Ladies Road and Black Boy\u2019s Hill, clues lost in these lopsided stones that Henbury\u2019s vandal helps to the ground and Henbury\u2019s conservationist tries to rectify, cleaning the vandal\u2019s pissy love-nest. African slave without a name, I\u2019d call this home by now. Would you? Your unknown soldier\u2019s tomb stands for shipload after shipload that docked, unloaded, watered, scrubbed, exercised and restocked thousands more souls for sale in Bristol\u2019s port; cab drivers speak of it all with yesterday\u2019s hurt. The good conservationist calls it her three hundred year war; those raids, deals, deceit and capture (a sore still raw). St. Paul\u2019s, Toxteth, Brixton, Tiger Bay and Handsworth: petrol bombs flower in the middle of roads, a sudden growth at the feet of police lines longer than any cricket pitch. African slave, your namelessness is the wick and petrol mix. Each generation catches the one fever love can\u2019t appease, nor molotov cocktails, nor when they embrace in a peace far from that three-named, two-bit vandal and conservationist binning beer cans, condoms and headstones in big puzzle-pieces. \n￼-2- Stop there black Englishman before you tell a bigger lie. You mean me well by what you say but I can\u2019t stand idly by. The vandal who keeps coming and does what he calls fucks on the cool gravestones, also pillages and wrecks. If he knew not so much my name but what happened to Africans, he\u2019d maybe put in an hour or two collecting his Heinekens; like the good old conservationist, who\u2019s earned her column inch, who you knock, who I love without knowing her name. The dead can\u2019t write, nor can we sing (nor can most living). Our ears (ifyou can call them ears) make no good listening. Say what happened to me and countless like me, all anon. Say it urgently. Mean times may bring back the water cannon. I died young, but to age as a slave would have been worse. What can you call me? Mohammed. Homer. Hannibal Jesus. Would it be too much to have them all? What are couples up to when one reclines on the stones and is ridden by the other? Will our talk excite the vandal? He woz ere, like you are now, armed with a knife, I could see trouble on his creased brow, love-trouble, not for some girl but for this village. I share his love and would have let him spoil my image, if it wasn\u2019t for his blade in the shadow of the church wall taking me back to my capture and long sail to Bristol, then my sale on Black Boy\u2019s Hill and disease ending my days: I sent a rumble up to his sole; he scooted, shocked and dazed. Here the sentence is the wait and the weight is the sentence. I\u2019ve had enough of a parish where the congregation can\u2019t sing. Take me where the hymns sound like a fountain-washed canary, and the beer-swilling, condom wielding vandal of Henbury, reclines on the stones and the conservationist mounts him, and in my crumbly ears there\u2019s only the sound of them sinning. \n￼1972 Year of departures and arrivals, Goodbyes and hellos, big hugs and waves, Promises and sworn affadavits of the soul, across time zones and seas, blood ties and wet eyes. Rain sagged power lines after it rained: miniature silver bats hung out to dry; seamless pockets of light; colourless tadpoles and targets. We pelted them to see light shatter. Light fell in sprinkles our stones loosened. The ones we missed did disappearing acts, fuelling talk about how each had gone to heaven in a great hand that grips a raindrop / between the index finger and thumb, and keeps a raindrop\u2019s sad, teardrop, shape; each one raised to where tired raindrops go, where they never dry up or lose shape: join us, we prosper. \n￼CANARD The days lance off windscreens blindingly. Nights fall hard on distressed furniture, on our heads soaked by pink soft tone bulbs. Dark glasses are worn in and outdoors. Pidgeons neck, preening on ledges ten floors up. Come, there is room for another. Kiss the nights and days goodbye. You\u2019re dizzy; when those birds push away, follow me. \n￼DOMESTIC FLIGHT I heard what I took for wind chimes 3000 feet above London\u2019s lights, each light a small sound. The pearl necklaces of traffic break, trying to get round my neck of the woods. The Thames ribbed and corseted by traffic despite its peregrinations in a black wetsuit. Occasionally real diamonds startle at high points in the city. Gold is on the horizon, a rim. Some distance below us an insect with a compound look and rotating wings hightails it home with bare ski feet. The river is Sanskrit in black ink scribbling away into the dark, turning over with each tide. \n￼GREENWICH REACH My mind fastened onto the rod. The fishes that are there answer my hook\u2019s singular enquiry once they have read the correct line: \"How do I know for sure you\u2019re fish and not pieces of old rubbish?\" Typically, fishes reply by swallowing the hook and bait. The Fisher of Men is Old Nick who wields a big death-dealing stick, he wishes to rejuvenate the Thames, not with scaly fishes. He means to relocate people. The question his hook asks doubles as his hungry hook\u2019s sole answer: \"You really don\u2019t want to die? You don\u2019t really have to die!\" Death winks at you in the water. Take the niggling, needling bait. Let your poor soul swim off the hook as a fish, not like those big fins stuck at Woolwich, too proud to eat, too fat to sink to a sound sleep. A fish\u2019s nightmare: to be in air like the thinner half of a line; to belong to a school whose day never ends, like those stranded fins floating in a giant soup, the Thames. \n￼STONE NESS The river bends back on itself as if to assess its own considered progress or mission The river counters this double back move with a twist in an opposite chartless direction The river sheds old skin in waves currents and sea tides a snake renewing reaching perfection \n￼SILVER SONG I know little about water, even less about light; all I see is the quick silver dancing there day and night. I want it all in my pocket. I wish it was my bank. In dream after dream I lock it up like fish in a tank. Don\u2019t ask what light has done to me, or what water has said; Not much, I\u2019ll say, they looked through me like I wasn\u2019t there or dead. Miles clocked up on city bridges, dawn and dusk by those shores, countless flat stones found and skidded on water\u2019s polished floor. Water and light, I must decline your invitation to me to dive and dive again for coins that you two mint for free. \n￼MAR- 6-93 SAT 17:46 ENGLISH DEPT FAX NO. 4135422141 SONNETS FROM WHITLEY BAY Troubled but not distressed.\u2019 (from a window in Durham Cathedral) -1- Stretches of this country smell so bad, I apologise, We laugh at your, T d think About my love for an Island that stinks.\" Those hours we took to find the North had Become a straight line: imperceptible curves Broken by an occasional roundabout, Until talk ran out and we banned ourselves From idle thoughts about the distant South, Wake up love. We\u2019ve long passed the border. The South is irredeemable. The slanted light From the early summer sun is colder, Now it casts elongated shadows of you and I Ascending the stairs to our love-nest Where we smell tired and unwilling to rest. -2- We always star in one another\u2019s dreams In full technicolour and super sixteen. We fall asleep like spoons and only turn When one or the other decides to turn. Morning is a silence that won\u2019t fracture. An elbow-room closeness and the odd gesture Confirms the other\u2019s thoughts in sea-air thick With desire. We nod our approval at brick In a city where I first said, I love you, Climbing the cathedral\u2019s 325 steps to view One shire shouldering the next, like molars, As God would have it or Buddha, or some polar Icecap and then the warming of the globe, Exactly as the heat I feel when inside you. \n￼These are the people I told you about, The ones with mostly goodness in their mouths. They treat us like old friends come back at last. The pints you and I lever to nought renew fast, Faster than we can toast the water of Tyneside. Late into the evening we find seats side by side. Our legs touch and when I shift it\u2019s to feel your hip As I see it through this straight glass at my lip^. I\u2019ve brought you here to be undressed by all Their kind and hungry eyes, only to take You to a Hi-Fi lit dark, Motown Soul, And enough spring water by the bed to slake The thirst of two flushed, open-mouthed lovers, Through locked-eyes, locked-arms, lockcd-hips hours. 4 My love you fill my head to distraction. I am pacing a room you hardly looked into, Furthest from the bedroom-cum-granary Where we lived and loved and woke in an aviary That quietened as the light intensified And objects muddled by the dark, clarified. All that night nothing could come between us, A sliver of light or dark couldn\u2019t separate us. By morning the bed had split into half- Us in a dividing current on two rafts; Us in our deep dreams, private and sweet. How did we drift apart, even in sleep? One look from you of panic, loss, love, And I leapt from my raft to share yours. \n￼I hold up your 501s against my waist To get the measure of you: come back, now, From that big, big city that pulled you away, To this one main street, coastal town, With five minute jams and one of most things. I knew between us, me and Whitley Bay, We couldn\u2019t make you stay. We tried everything: Flora and fauna, the seas light displays. Your long, elegant legs opened fluently. I eased into a wet, warm, silky place That made us gasp, quicken, then rock gently- Our eyes searching one another\u2019s eyes and face, When not one of ninety nine cars registered Passing the house in the rush-hour was heard. -6- This kind of loving wrecks the body, Makes it impossible to function properly. You wake up mid-morning feeling like the night before. But to go back to bed would turn your head forever. You stay on your feet and sway like a ship Becalmed, waiting for anything to happen, to slip Your world back into orbit, but nothing does, Except the light slips and you register a dull pulse. The ship is hers and the sea is hers, the light You see the world by, hers; the loving that night Was all hers; the feeling that you\u2019re wrecked, hers. The love you think is a blessing is a curse, A weakness, something not hers, but yours: stop, Before you have no pulse, before you drop. \n￼1: MAR- 6-93 SAT 17:47 ENGLISH DEPT FAX NO. 4135422141 P.10 You're in the bedroom, I'm in some g^m. I'm wanting to grow more big, youdoubly thin. Our love is somewhere halfwav/oetween the two, Looking fol\\someone that\u2019s neither me nor you. You ask, what\u2019s up? I haye to tell you straight, Our precious lov&s in trouble, the worst state, You stop in recognition, give me your all, I start to talk but/reall}N^ant to bawl. Love was the/Eve that madOdife with you Eden. Now love\u2019s gone my life\u2019s the Vorld\u2019s worst garden. Look atyhow our love ends in some\\rorridor, That's^nobody's quarters, nor a safe rhjor: When all we ever wanted and couldn\u2019t get eqough of Was love, just love, pure love and more love. -8- Your touch, I\u2019d nearly forgot ton your touch! And you've been gone less than a month, much- Less; yet here I am using poetry as hype To conjure you from a Daguerreotype; From a past neither of us could have known. The fine tremour in your hands is mine now, As is that chain of sweat on your upperlip. I offer my China silk hanky whose tip Sticks out of my top left hand jacket pocket And a half-smilc: take it, use it to mop The sweat beaded on fur so delicate It might be kissed away, not electrocuted. All I can do is call you up and hope you\u2019ll come, And pray that in calling you, no harm\u2019s done. / \n￼-9- The miles between you and I open up. The days stretch out against all my wishes. I fight betrayal when a hand brushes mine, Prefering a bruise from an upper cut Delivered by one of Whitley Bay\u2019s British Movement. A stranger\u2019s eyes make four with mine, I hot up instantly like a four bar blues Launched by Muddy Waters or B.B. King. Not so long ago we watched a moon in a shoe Step from that shoe which changed to something We couldn\u2019t name, as clouds do, then the moon Perched on a lake big like the sea; that moon Looked like it owned the lake and all around. But we watched it fall into that lake and drown. r - 10- When I turn my back on this North of Norths And I kiss you goodbye, how come it hurts? When sealit winds loosen a stinging rain On Whitley Bay, your tears drown out mine. This curved beach of seaweed and stones Shows from my wavy footprints I\u2019m all alone. The waves form an orderly queue to see Who\u2019s the miserable man bringing misery. When those waves wreck in despair on sandstone, It\u2019s my back breaking with my need for home. I give up town and sea for glass and concrete, And a capital adding to itself, House by red brick house on the For Sale shelf, And new-post-code street by tarmacked street. f \n￼FRAIL DEPOSITS ( for Wilson Harris ) \n￼The Trench Revisited W e\u2019re being driven past when you point to Where you\u2019d pushed in a friend long, long ago, Into what was a trench, to test its depth. You say it taught you how a civilisation, Feeling a blow or tug may still not know A hand\u2019s involved, so can\u2019t feel indebted. I was falling, horizontally, just To keep up and lucky to win your trust. Push him again, he\u2019ll fall on land that\u2019s dry This time and think nothing of it, and you\u2019ll Bank all that knowledge lifted from the sight Your friend made clad in mud, convinced totally That he slipped and your hand on his ribcage Was your brave, unlucky, one-hand-clap save! \n￼A Jealous God The light on our first morning at breakfast Is such that three women as many hundreds Of yards away in pleated, cotton frocks\u2019/as Blinding as if the green, yellow and red Are light sources and we\u2019re in some studio Within touching distance of them; we look Their way, quiet and still, more like study Than look, they are grouped close, signing their talk. The sun is a jealous God are your words. Suddenly nothing means much anymore; Watching those three women, a timeless world Regards us as much as we regard her: We feed like enraged Ugolino fed, Though captive, on his captured jailer\u2019s head. \n￼- iii - Bone Flute \"This your son?\" enquires the curator As we waltz in for our official tour. You finger the thousand year flute of bone As if about to burst out with a tune. You tell how the bone came from an enemy, Morsels of whose flesh is consumed by them. When air is blown into the fashioned bone, The enemy\u2019s knowhow and plans are summoned. The flute I\u2019m trying to blow a tune on Belongs to you, got by me over years from Stringing your thoughts sentence by sentence, Or what must stand for you in your absence: Having to check when I\u2019ve said something To see if it\u2019s yours since it has your ring. / \n￼- iv - Seawall You explain rudimentary quantum theory: The frailty of us jetting above weather From one world touching down in another With a wheel-screech equaling our surprise. Ah, to leave marks in this life that survive! That outstrip the skids of a jet\u2019s tyre! The stretch of seawall we walk looks breached. A man who seems too fit to beg wants change. The sea is muddy, loud and creased in the distance. We have to lean a little into a welcome breeze, Our heads bowed from the direct beat of sun. The soldiers in barracks reach us in waves Dictated by the wind\u2019s direction and pace; / Dear God, I think, don\u2019t let this moment pass. A- \n￼Rain on the slate roof and more rain collects in gutters then down drains. Where does the picture come from of it falling up? I hear a rhythm: drips, slips, taps, smatterings rattles; out of this a pattern surfaces that is thought itself. Then the thought purely to do with rain, turns right on itself, as if against all that water washing the world, reverses water up drains to rise off the roofslates to where it\u2019s still, floats, and is weightless. \n￼- ii - Cold in a room that won\u2019t be driven out by heat, hangs solid like a gas lantern or mosquito net or drapes or a web dangling preciously in a strip of light. I look at why it has settled for here. The shape of the room is no longer room-shape but the form cold takes settling in a place; and I don\u2019t belong; heat doesn\u2019t belong. I am no longer simply feeling cold, I am being asked to leave, pushed out by it into another cold, into the open where size and blue puts the cold in capitals. t \n￼Early morning light weighs nothing. Lacking the conviction, it cuts in windows, but avoids corners; filling the room with live shadows. The roof over my head takes on extra layers and new pressures. I am instructed not to move, even a mere flicker could demolish this delicate balance. The main beam is not the main beam I take it for but the very weakness I see and criticise in light. I begin this apology, noiseless, urgent and scared that the roof might collapse and light fall flush on me, and I might end up crushed. \n￼NOTTING HILL -i- car-ni-val car-ni-val car-ni-val this is car-ni-val peacocks with feathers of the rainbow wings\u2019 spread held all day the robes of kings drag yards behind heads-above-their-own crowns sway car-ni-val car-ni-val car-ni-val this is car-ni-val bare-b^ced straight-backed princes strapped to the steel pan and the bass princess in a tassle of diamonds glitters as she rattles her waist car-ni-val car-ni-val car-ni-val this is car-ni-val freedom fighters in battle dress the spirit of their banners in their dance tinselled toddlers on shoulders wide-eyed in the wildest of dreams car-ni-val car-ni-val car-ni-val this is car-ni-val / ","docTitle":"","docDate":"2014-07-01 09:50:41.326"},"meta":{"contentType":"text/raw","emVer":"7.1.1103.5","langIdVer":"DefaultLangId","processingVer":"CalaisJob01","submissionDate":"2014-07-01 09:50:35.834","submitterCode":"57b17a53-6e34-87b0-20ff-a419896f49c9","signature":"digestalg-1|gHkHSiMBTFCbHDbWXwslNM72U98=|b3y+7Wg3eJ3a8+CFumxlbPNXfNCNM90HsUh1jadfZ+8y2nzPuq6O7g==","language":"English"}},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/8b37cb17-220c-379e-9e47-19417e41a374/lid/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http://d.opencalais.com/lid/DefaultLangId/English"},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/373e7c3c-5875-3705-b102-36601dd8fa85":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"Position","name":"good conservationist","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/Position","instances":[{"detection":"[drivers speak of it all with yesterday\u2019s hurt. ]The good conservationist[ calls it her three hundred year war; those]","prefix":"drivers speak of it all with yesterday\u2019s hurt.
