Some said his spirit kindled at his throat. He stamped it out. He kept his emotions at bay. One day Finding them wrung, he weighted and drowned them One by one. Pity sank without trace. Fear sank, then Love. Setting his face, He held his great anger down And saw it drown. He felt so empty then. The reservoir was low, The ducts were dry, the blood was cold. He could not find his feet, his head was light, Like an air balloon - He clambered aboard And rose. Bottomless the sky; looking down He saw the cloth of the earth unfold, The pattern of river and town, Snake of a track, quilt of cloud. When would the secret be told? All day it was light, the night Kept him afloat. At dawn He felt wings. He knew flight. He soared. \n￼Facts About Water Be ready for the flood, they said. I gathered my skirts. No flood came. Beware the danger that comes with a man, They said. I waited for the fall. In blinding light A man came stumbling to us from the stones. Was this the man? He fell at our feet, Fire, famine, flood. Give him his name, they said. I was drawn to the man, I told him This is your name, and then he was all I saw, The first I knew of endless, immeasurable calm, The whole struggle over and done. I had expected pain, instead He treated me with care, folding and wrapping, I had never been given before. He gave me to myself, said without saying Love if you will, but be warned, I have very little. Here was a man Without the anchor of dreams. He blinked in the sun, he hardly seemed At home in his set of bones. 1 felt his uncontrol Reined in with a shaky hand. I said, If you need me in the night Call out. Trains run beneath my house. His flame flickered, but did not go out, I conjured a green field to steady him, No gate, no way in or out, But a cool mile of young grass And four spare dry stone walls To hold him in. I had never held anyone in before. In return, he brought me to his shore, He wrote in the sand Facts about water. Minim, fathom, barrel, cord. Magnum, gallon, jeroboam. He said When you wake far out, Dream a boat, and with these things Make good your return, and he wrote: Sextant, compass, dipstick, dial, Plumb, octant, nautical mile. He left me sleeping, I woke without fear, In a rigged vessel, sails and mast, \n￼1dreamed my way to dry land, Acre, arpent, section, square, League, light-year, township, are. \n￼Fall We sit over Indian bones And over the silent, Sitting up, Buried ones. Bob Hass laughs about Dickinson And tells us it is Okay to be slow And confusion is all part of what is Meant to be. I finger the silence that follows A poem's end. It is the sound Of having been there, the hard despair That follows Pain getting words And after rain You can hear the drops Staying in the trees. Sometimes the day tumbles early But coming up from the Mining Circle The grass yearns down To the figure of a girl In bronze Green as rain, and such bewilderment Is part of what is Meant to be. t \n￼He Isn\u2019t There She is a single note of the song Without him; she gets it wrong, The blood stops going to her head, She sees stars. She almost gets run over Without him; into rush-hour's cars She steps out, thinking of His forearm's blond hairs, His slenderness. Everything has a ghost Every spirit has a double Her lost half cries out for its Lost other. She senses trouble At the source, tries to block out The wrong sounds, the noise, the noise, Was that his quiet voice? She opens her mouth But without him no sound comes out. She stands in the traffic Crying in cold air her single note And he isn't there. \n￼Heartbreak Hour His flat is all Oasis, warmth of books. He gives me tea And offers the missing piece Ofa picture: Low skies and a lake iced-over, I tell him about Love's quavering note, He says there will always be A man's hand cupping my chin, Look to the light, he says, All ice is thin. Leaving there at four, heartbreak hour, The air is freezing over And the blind animals Fretting in the small of my heart Are begging me To write the stories of ice and fire. The journal of leaving behind Oases, and facing The solid grey door And my own walls, my silences. \n￼In his room Inside his room, life was A balancing of weights It was a memorable sight - All that man, Contained, And those who called him mad Trawled that word from their shallow hearts, Yet, spine-arched, their napes too Were resting lightly on the truth. I first saw him as I swam up-stream He burned bridges His face took the river colours He was one who lived perpetual spring, When he turned after rain, When he let the leaves be blown, That was unknowing, And I too lost time, growing with him, Became a changeless thing. Like smoked-out rabbits, Ears back, We fled the turns, Of tide, of season, of the day; And could I have known That so much fright would fall upon the warren, On the riverside And on his spring, I might have found the perfect height And flung my spirit down. \n￼Letter (on a beach) Down to cold stone To whet my heart. It is not long, The letter with the burning lines. Hearts are sore, mine sings A mournful tune I have to listen to. The beach is raw, White waves crashing down on sin, Sky washed and the water in, Coke can in the undertow, A gull runs shakily at the edge. Wave after wave And the foam climbing up the dark Underbelly. The dark could punish But it comes too late - gull takes fright. A tightness climbs my throat My wings are trembling, White envelope, The end, the wrapper, the crumbs, the dregs. The weekend falls back like a medium weight. The letter walls me out, I feel Nothing And nothing is better. \n￼Loom Our house stands Quite alone on the road It darkens and darkens, The doorbell rings into the gloom, We cannot let light in, We are seldom home. The house is many-cornered It has an angular voice Its spirit is noosed; Light from the streets Makes frosted squares on wallpaper there The drive lights make more squares; Shadowy paintings, blurred books Jigsaw the dark. These pieces make memory up. We are kept tight within our bones By places, names, and childhood happenings; Meals that have been taken there; People wearing faces they will cast away, Sun shining through the rooms, Getting lost somehow. No need to shape the tones, The house spins its own, That frail loom the builders raised in days. They put the wires in That hum and sing in spinning out The crazy, half-heard tunes That make the spaces at my fingertips Vibrate, as though sent Through a different element. \n￼Mist The singing goes on, lonely, in the mist Long after dark. Up on my second floor I follow the score. On the window face A clammy smile, spreading, white, Nothing behind the eyes, The chilled limbs invading my few rooms. I turn to find at home, Comfortable in my easy chair, Body without bone, Whispering with the books. Sweating the air, exchanging looks With the family photographs, Billowing secrets under its breath. The kitchen cradles the dark, The fridge has started quietly to hum To my foggy guest, the phone Shrilly Fails to ring. If it would only rain And damp down my unwelcome friend, Or I could make the move to fire, And paint my home \n￼Paddington The taxis line up in the sooty air, I wait for a later train. Above us all a net is cast in the gloom It hangs above the clocks you can hardly see For grime. They have given up the struggle, They wander in time as the platforms thicken And grow lean, I wish I were not this faint dishevelled me With the stoppable heart, always an eye out For the leap of light, The shaft of yellow I turn from, Healed for a spell. The sun is red, The ordinary lives Are running out on narrow rails, The engine growls at the rear, I stop my ears, I turn from the snub end of the beast, Ashamed that the sound Can so dismantle my peace of mind. I look to the three arches for black grace, A sense of light coming apart And coming together, up in the birdnote rafters The organ-music heights; I think I have to climb down, get on a train, And sit tight. \n￼Patience A game of patience The cards tap on the flat Table-top; it is late, I keep my letters tucked Down between the flower pot And night; marry the gentleman You met in the gallery, they say, Live like we do, be happy, And write back without delay. I shuffle the cards, Life is not dealt straight, The King has left his Queen - He poured the fire that lit her crown And when he left she let herself go out. She sat down. Memory pulls on its chains, I find a place Near the end, my wishes are weightless, I lay the cards On the rough table-top, they stir dust. The motes set up a thin cry. Her kingdom in flames By her red King the Queen is laid, Heart, heart, diamond, spade. \n￼Poles the mind runs north to south the weirs in the river thought turn round the rivers in the heart's valley turn; heading west i lose my sense of self, of home, and how the land lies. the bus groans as though in pain against livid barriers; prevailing winds fold their gags into my mouth, the land lies north to south her waters turn to follow the moon, the cold lies flat along the ground, frosts calm the earth's trouble, she is black and white from pole to pole, the great whites, north and south, the snow wastes and ice caps, and then the deeper blacks where space roars, way beyond, as though out there all darkness found a voice. \n￼Potsdamer Platz, Berlin The comers of the world moved close After the wall Fell and was flattened and filled. People dared to walk In the wide streets and the empty places. Potsdamer, where an old man stumbled to a seat In the weeds, Potsdamer Platz where they will Build and lose a world. Point by point a shape emerges, The blocky offices, flawless, linear, Behind the old memorial church with its Bombed spire That I admire because it Fails to please, Because it hangs out human memory In the breeze, Because it grieves. Clean glass heals the open stone, The markets drip jewellery, Silver bands and candles, hats, And over Spandauer Strasse The statues standing out against the dusk Sing of the wide streets and empty places, O f Potsdamer Platz where they will build, Two years after the wall Fell and was lifted and filled, With hardly a scar, the tar tissue knitted so well, I stand for the last time in a place Wide as the space a man's life takes to fill. \n￼Reflex She crouched in the corner of her head The ache of sanity passed The bricks of the wall held her there, Eyes quenched, Darkness about the mouth Her back to the words. She was a crafter Moulding her absence with bare hands, Dovetailing silences, Learning and learning, blind and divining The age of shadows, their grainy touch, The lie of them. We brought her shelter: A cardigan of words she would seldom wear; The nouns she devoured, Survival balanced, melting, on the tongue; But the verbs, tensed in their paradigms, She had no purpose for, And cast away. \n￼Shipped Life stretches far, many things come right, The sea yawns crisply to the ship's stern. Tonight I am possessed By reaches dark and out of sight, Unexpressed wishes race us out of port, Heads high, sailorcapped, They cheer briefly as we wheel, and clap Against the pier one last time As the land pencils to a foreign line. The wind chokes, fouled in the spume, There are wind-spirits out tonight Our trail is knuckle-white Hard bone under little flesh. I will wake in waves, wondering Was this where I drowned last night? \n￼Sung through fire I put a match to music Up came this soft drum Those plaintive flames Those strings. Fire came down upon my house Many things were lost The sun came down. My children, playing with water. Did not bum. My father Toying with words Could turn a phrase to burn my ears But chose instead Love's gentle word. When I was a child, I fell asleep To my mother's song To the light under the door The muffled mysteries of the adult world. Sometimes I recall that song I am almost child again And to my children Sing lullabies through fire Watching their faces in the red light. Most of knowing Is not knowing but a guess; Rage at the signs of nothingness Fury and fear Disappointment, disillusionment And in the end Among the ashes Love. \n￼The Swimmer Into the risky waters of another month Bottle and paddle, milk-crate raft, I swim against the small choppy waves. The children shout from the beach. I am fighting my reluctance, Almost dread, to take the water on, I would rather swim In lakes that make the body Yellow green, and where there is no bed; I wear a fluid dress, A thing of grace then, the swimmers are A family of slender girls. I swam like that On the last day, on the first beach, Exulting in The sweet milk of being alone in it; And when the water called For a change of element, I breathed it in And that Was easily done.
