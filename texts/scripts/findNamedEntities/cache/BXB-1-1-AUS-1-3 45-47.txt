When the door began to crack \u2019Tivas like a stick across my back It seemed an important dream: wounded, he came to me for help and safety; I kept him in the innermost room and barred the series of doors that led to him, but later I could not find the way back myself, the locks too many. I sit up in bed in the dark and think about it: door barrier or door opening, and how to keep the balance between its dual uses in a life growing too private, too enclosed - a nunnery walks about the littered streets in full daylight on a weekday, not once creaking wide its disguising grille or guiding a route through complicated cloisters to my cell. <9 And the wounded hero? Ah, here\u2019s where I\u2019ve made the rod for my own back. Come clean. I love the falconer who gave up even shipping\u2019s sociability as a boy. He has the locks and shutters to match mine, the drawbridges, portcullises, iron bolts and chains, the dark barn with its moat of field surrounding. I sit up in bed in the night and consider strategy: when I break through the barriers that have held me just obsessed, watching him from afar, I\u2019ll have to tell him. When in the morning the letter comes through the door - \u2018You were Wendy\u2019s friend. Please think back to what she was doing, to where she used to go, who and what she talked about\u2019 - I lay it aside for the moment, completely immersed in my larger project, of laying siege to Joe\u2019s defences in some believably natural manner, not courting humiliation or telling lies. It\u2019s easy to feel no more than fifteen or so, ritually inscribing \u2018I love him\u2019 in a diary last thing at night, writing \u2018Jonas Hinds\u2019 on the inside covers of all my school exercise books, or carving it on a branch - that stick again. / 45 e \n￼Austin 35-64 10/2/93 4:34 pm Page 46 L 8. When my back began to smart \u2019Twas like a penknife in my heart Hands and face hotter than the weather justifies, I walk over the endless openness of the field to Jonas\u2019s barn in its disguise of ivy. I\u2019ve found no pretext for my presence there, but have come anyway, the dream a goad behind me. Now or never, says my head, take up your bravery at once and use, or lose, it. It\u2019s not, after all, as though he\u2019s an absolute stranger; there are things we can talk about - old times, new countries. But the shock-headed youth who comes to the door is someone I don\u2019t know, and I am speechless. I am leaving a note - \u2018I must speak to you about something.\u2019 He is rolling^wadded newspaper laid under perches to absorb the droppings, replacing it with fresh sheets. Friendly enough, he, one at a time, unhoods the hawks for me. I move in to stare into their unrelenting agate eyes out of another morality entirely. \u2018Don\u2019t touch them,\u2019 he says - the tip of each beak is a needle, each separate talon has a stranglehold upon its pole. A worm of fear of Jonas enters me. When we drink tea quite silently together, the birds behind us shift and lightly murmur. There was that battleground that Joe walked into in my vision. I think of it, of the otherness of his creatures, retracing my journey with my courage leashed - though not the loving. And find a pretext waiting. The letter says, in Letraset capitals and newspaper cut-outs, \u2018If you\u2019re looking for Wendy Christopher, ask Jonas Hinds.\u2019 As much a weapon as a claw, a knife, a beak, a needle, it makes little slashes in herringbone pattern on my heart, so sharp it\u2019s shock I feel, a stop of breath before the bleeding. 46 o / \n￼. K.J He talked about the pain it gave him to see her name written, having tried to omit-tfe* memory from his life but failed completely. He had grown used to her fleeting ghost in the barn - the flag of bright hair always caught for a moment in the sunlight before she went out of his door into the day. She was ever going away. At first he had pursued her presence, then he learnt she stayed seconds longer if he could just sit quiet and receive the tawny gold and energy that was Wendy, passing through his life again and not gone, thank God. Though she had left him - \u2018nothing more about me to find out\u2019 he said. Two months before her disappearance she had said goodbye and really stood for the last time in his doorway, before following her curiosity elsewhere. \u2018But it didn\u2019t stop me loving her. I\u2019ll always do that.\u2019 The bleeding starts from that arsenal of one weapon. I sit beside him and begin to leak my heart away on his dry ground - though going inside the nunnery of my head to properly spurt and puddle and lie down, drawing the grille tight shut behind me with a final clang. ^ v.) Austin 35-64 10/2/93 4:35 pm Page 47 9. When my heart began to bleed \u2019Twas death and death and death indeed A falcon, its jesses trailing, swoops in circles over us before it settles on the barn\u2019s ridgepole. The ivy\u2019s thickness makes a shade wide enough to sit in. Jonas holds the paper with its anonymous lettering in both hands. Lines from the sides of his hawk nose draw his mouth down at the corners. He looks at the message again, then as before he looks through the message to the ground that\u2019s arid and dusty under the ivy with only a woodlouse going about its grey business into the deeper shadow. her f G- -e- / 47 ","docTitle":"","docDate":"1993-10-02"},"meta":{"contentType":"text/raw","emVer":"7.1.1103.5","langIdVer":"DefaultLangId","processingVer":"CalaisJob01","submissionDate":"2014-07-01 08:44:37.522","submitterCode":"57b17a53-6e34-87b0-20ff-a419896f49c9","signature":"digestalg-1|l7acMkJWWu7HxcfIQ3zUSc3PyR8=|Vt/+81Y34usdAjylIVifRhYdCs5UHCyGvfIKdxs5Dwbm6prH//+klw==","language":"English"}},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/1e8bf496-55af-3ff5-b0f0-ec5517448a0c/cat/1":{"_typeGroup":"topics","category":"http://d.opencalais.com/cat/Calais/Hospitality_Recreation","classifierName":"Calais","categoryName":"Hospitality_Recreation","score":0.721},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/1e8bf496-55af-3ff5-b0f0-ec5517448a0c/lid/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http://d.opencalais.com/lid/DefaultLangId/English"},"http://d.opencalais.com/pershash-1/4c10a166-0263-331c-a91a-e312f41bed4c":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"Person","name":"Wendy Christopher","persontype":"N/A","nationality":"N/A","commonname":"Wendy Christopher","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/Person","instances":[{"detection":"[the letter comes through the door - \u2018You were ]Wendy[\u2019s friend.
