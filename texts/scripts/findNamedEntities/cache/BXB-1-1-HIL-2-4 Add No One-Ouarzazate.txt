I want to squash him flat. He\u2019s like my Uncle Pat\u2019s gold cigarette-case that flies open when you touch it. You cruise along the fence with your elbow on the rolled-down window-edge. Everything you come near falls to bits. The cattery sells bedding-plants and runner-beans. Someone has been up here to mow a tiny lawn, and hang a sign above it, opposite the fence I mentioned and the bank, before the airman came. The way the green brim of your Chinese sun-hat\u2019s been turned up - it\u2019s like the tail on a bulldog\u2019s bum. Help me to take no notice, holy flowers! The passenger, the passenger, I don\u2019t want to be the passenger. Please can we stop at the Trout Lakes. You came into my bedroom carrying a duck, for we lived together happily for five years. (She was so tame, they wrote about her in the Whitby Gazette.) And now you\u2019re driving a saloon I\u2019ve come to hate \n￼round and round the camp like a bum. I think I\u2019m going to say I want to leave you. I want to leave you. The hearts on the shutters make the houses look like cuckoo-clocks, or little chalets \u2014 can you hear the cow-bells tinkle? \u2014 where Mother Bear and Father Bear eat fondue. They overlook the fence and the bank. The airman walks away to living-quarters we can\u2019t see like a zoo animal. He polishes his boots. He\u2019s far from home. Deep in trout lakes on the other side trouts\u2019 dreams of flies come true ... Not all the women of England are boiling kettles by the tall gates but I love them all. They shelter in the oaks on the soft verges where the airman lights up his king-size cigarette. \n￼Ouarzazate Flies are entering my mouth. They drink at my eyes. They love them. I\u2019ve lost my hands so how can I brush them away? C\u2019est toujours midi, Madame. My heart goes boom pause boom pause boom. Don\u2019t touch me, je vous en prie, or I\u2019ll kill you.
