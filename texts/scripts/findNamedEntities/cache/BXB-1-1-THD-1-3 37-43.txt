Alphaville I watch you, glacial in mink, enter on the arm of your husband, imperious through the sighs of your fans, the autographs.

Love is a cutting-room, all images equally true, I mix them all up in you, au revoir becomes^ t'aime in the crystal at your ear, as I direct your hand to stretch for husband, lover; the camera is crazy for you. A film can be cut like steel in alphaville. Your hands in the pit of your back, steel grapples to eyes of steel; your breasts on hoardings star; swiftly you brush your hair; your husband is crazy for you. Our son must be fetched from school. Blinds of the late afternoon are falling one by one. Light opens on the steel evening of alphaville.

I whisper this in your ear: stretch out your hand to him, but remember our mountain-cabin; preserve it in snow of your tear; converse on what is real in alphaville. You are light falling on breasts, you are a stocking\u2019s stretch, you are the heel on a shoe, you are a brush through hair, you are a collar turned up, you are the leaves you crunch, you are the wheel of a car, life is in love with you; you are the sad, steel thrill that steals through alphaville.
