And when it hatched, and scratched, She took no notice. His words were fledglings and she had the power To feed them or to dash them. She chose, or made no choice, it happened They fell on stony ground and squirmed Like worms or the soul of man, exposed. Her Letter He keeps her between two slices of gold, A sandwich Totally inedible. 55 e \n￼Randall 37-end 25/3/93 1:01 am Page 5, Ophelia Drowning Come back into the stream, Lie among the morphine and the dream, Seal the shadows to your breast Then rest, Sweet troubled girl. Go down beneath the lilies kindly hands For they shall take the fire from off your brow, And waters quench you; Sleep among the herbs and minnow. No more tears. The heron sups your eyes And flies with angels. I can\u2019t let her go on lecturing me as if she were the Archangel Michael and the Blessed Virgin in one - because flesh and blood won\u2019t stand it. The Snow Were creatures of a hothouse, She especially, Maiden ferns loll out their tongues To lick her beads of dogma, Ambergris oozed from her fervid imagination. A girl with the mad rolling eyes of a saint / Looking for heaven. She found satan. She finds satan in me, A dark coil ready to spring And she uncertain whether to court or cure me. 56 ","docTitle":"","docDate":"1993-03-25"},"meta":{"contentType":"text/raw","emVer":"7.1.1103.5","langIdVer":"DefaultLangId","processingVer":"CalaisJob01","submissionDate":"2014-07-01 09:56:54.951","submitterCode":"57b17a53-6e34-87b0-20ff-a419896f49c9","signature":"digestalg-1|QflNEyV5MrFTR6ratUXvitKglQM=|Pbq/fGh2osMAvUSU81ThVGwk9R9eO8snrfqiuJNYFNWzt2+tlEtDmg==","language":"English"}},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/43a84d2a-1fc9-357e-a4eb-3b3e31bc22b7/lid/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http://d.opencalais.com/lid/DefaultLangId/English"}}
