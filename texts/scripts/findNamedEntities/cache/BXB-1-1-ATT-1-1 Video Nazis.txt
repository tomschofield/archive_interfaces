In Rome the gladiators fought while people slobbered in the stands the bloodlust rose, the voyeurs wanked with transfixed gase and frenzied hands then naked humans thrown to beasts were torn apart amidst the cheers their last entreaties drowned in blood and wine-soaked sick sadistic jeers And still it swells, the evil lust centuries old and still unslaked the cesspit of the human mind the vampire free, unchained, unstaked and now sick men - it's always men - are harnessing the stinking vulture lurking in the human soul and flaunting it as video culture Film-makers, impotent and scared with shrivelled pricks and sick desires t hate women so they bum their breasts or wrench their nipples off with pliers and hipsters in the glossy press say 'What's the fuss? It's special effects.' It's real enough in those bastards' minds - I want to break their fucking necks! And what of those who watch the films of Nazis raping Jewish mothers? Do they sit there, and wank, and spout wish they'd been there beside the others then play with children of their own like S.S. butchers used to do? Look in the mirror, nasty man - see Adolf Eichmannn stare at you! \n￼In 1982, after Lord Denning had ruled Ken Livingstone's GLC fares policy illegal, forcing massive increases in London Transport fares, I wrote a piece called 'Awayday' about the perils of a day out in London with the Law Lords. In the light of (Ex Comrade) Yeltsin's activities in Russia I thought it was time for an update - so here we go on the perils of a day's shopping in the new, 'democratic' 'CIS' (which I always thought meant Co-operative Insurance Society, actually) woke up got up read the post attacked the postman took the rat for a walk but hordes of starving children grabbed it and ate it raw came back fed the amoeba but it still wasn't big enough to be seen with the naked eye so i thought i'd fatten it up a bit more before i put it in the casserole emptied the flower pot and made some coffee invented a new machine which produces genuine 100% beef hamburgers out of old copies of lenin's memoirs while simultaneously reconciling the armenians and aserbajanis wrote a passionate love letter to the head of cis food distribution who happens to be a small crucian carp then thought i'm bored think i'll go to moscow cos moscow's got to be more interesting than the eec catering size frankfurter tin i've lived in since my house was repossessed by the original pre revolutionary owners and i might be able to pick up some bucks fizz bootlegs or the latest jean-paul sartre dub lp got the bus two hours late got the train four hours late train was delayed for a week due to huge crowds of pimps drug dealers americans gangsters child pomographers and manic street preachers fans celebrating the restoration of capitalism and the collapse of soviet power got to moscow went into the bread shop queued for nine hours loaf of bread please sure mate that'll be a hundred roubles what d'you mean a hundred roubles it was only ten kopeks last week i'm not paying a hundred roubles for a loaf of bread sorry mate i know it was only ten kopeks last week but an unstable semi-alcoholic crypto  fascist egomaniac authoritarian opportunist who spent forty odd years as an unquestioning stalinist apparatchik slavishly toeing the party line had a few words with margaret thatcher and then reconstituted himself as a paragon of freedom by organising a fake army \n￼/ coup and looking ever so brave by standing on a tank surrounded by his cia backers has taken power and turned the country into a devil take n privatised and the prices have gone up ten thousand per cent that'll be a hundred roubles please..... bollocks to that i said and after a short pregnant pause all the people behind me in the queue plucked up courage and said bollocks to that and all the homeless starving people begging in the streets said bollocks to that and all the jews victimised by openly marauding anti Semitic gangs encouraged by the authorities said bollocks to that arid all the war veterans who defended leningrad not st Petersburg said bollocks to that and the relatives of all the people killed in the interethnic wars said bollocks to that and the mothers of all the kids murdered by gangsters and ravaged by drugs and left to die for want of hospital treatment said bollocks to that arid the millions of people thrown on the scrapheap in the name of rationalisation and market forces said bollocks to that and we're forming a mass revolutionary party and it's going to have a hammer and sickle on it and we're going to take power again and this time we're not going to confuse perestroika with selling out to capitalism and our slogan, manifesto and programme is going to be bread piece and land..and.... bollocks to that !
