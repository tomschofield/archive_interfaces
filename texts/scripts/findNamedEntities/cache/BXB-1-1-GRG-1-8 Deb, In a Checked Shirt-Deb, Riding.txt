Father taught me no one else was good enough - little wonder I must work till I bleed, bop till I drop at local dances. I can split a match with a woodsman's axe and have no lasting lovers. The way I roll my sieves, that final tuck's my father, the shirt is yours as I am mine - I've taken every risk but that. Father told me: give up nothing. So I don't when I undress; you saw my eyes when you asked me to unbutton more. Ho can do. Your shirt is wringing but I like sweating me as you did.

But too much needs done round here for private groaning, too many stray heads and hungry hands for her to pine - her mouth flicks, she picks up the reins again. Something else, these assured young women who have not lost, who train their luck and ride it, sure they always will - Get off with it? Likely one day she'll be thrown and twitching in the dirt will suss she can't get up again. Ho blame, but she'll be frightened and ashamed. May someone be bending over her then, hold out his hand and drawl: 'Welcome to the world of mortals, angel, it's tough not being tough enough. How impress me. Take my hand and with your other salute those griefs we cannot master, <*£ stumbling home beside them as they stamp so proud.'
