Who first saw Caspar, his heart's love and his faith  ful hound, come out of a sunny wood that blue after  noon, hungry, radiant and careless? It was a travell- ing salesman, travelling to visit his in the absence of her lord; and not liking the look of them he alerted the authorities. There was a scene outside the village postofi'ice, the absconciers being at first unwilling to climb into the ocen jaws of the institut  ion van. The salesman, unfastening his tie, watched from a convenient window. The dog, whose name was Fix, did a brave job, to the amusement of the few onlookers, defending his master and mistress. They v/ere persuaded in a kindly voice that all resistance was hopeless. They were reminded that it was approaching tea-time. They were given certain assurances concerning the fate of doggy. Soon with bowed heads they were contemplating the caked mud on their shoes, and in the windowless vehicle riding home. We are to imagine love in the asylum as thereafter run  ning rough, for the cover of the unhappy couple was blown. Kule number one in a place like that.being: attract no undue attention, now they could not prosper. At some of the teasing and innuendo they blushed with pride. Eh, Jo? he grinned, didn\u2019t we? weren\u2019t we? But what they nad been and had done attracted interference as a rose cankers. Lovers in corners playing with each other\u2019s hands, lovers eye to eye across the common table, lovers silently smiling in the usual hubbub, this is ask  ing for it. Besides, they were more demanding, having lain together in a wood. The ordinary discipline irked them worse, they could see no sense in it. Rota is a fine thing for an empty man, but if the miraculous happens and he catches a passion the day's official timetable goes over him like a harrow. At least, that has been my exper- xence and I generously ascribe it to our/friend here. Why, to go no further back than my Ragged School days, I distinctly remember what I suffered in compulsory assemb  ly and during the inane chanting of our two times table and throughout our mechanical responses in divinity, \n￼when all the while my heart was elsewhere, with the young matron in fact, who fingered our stubby heads for lice. There can be no doubt, I think, that the lad in question when set to a manly task apart from her at a womanly must have chafed and fretted and got no good from the activity intended as beneficial. See now how in the ab  sence of so gross an ersatz as the Ape he tears with his teeth mercilessly at his innocent nails and the adjoining skin until all ten fingers are bloody. That for an Ape. For the waif Jo, the quick-running and irresponsibly laughing, what must his self-devouring have been like? Their reunions then at playtime were headlong and a source of entertainment for everybody present. The controlling gods in white and their servants in green shook their heads more in sorrow than in anger and for»bore a little longer to intervene. It entered Caspar's head as he lay there one night list  ening to owls that she, his herte dere, was betraying him with a charge nurse by the name of Henry. Innumerable proofs avalanched upon him at once. At breakfast time, red with sleeplessness and weeping, his eyes implored her to come quickly through the door alone and looking for him; but she chose that morning to dawdle in chatting tab with a fellow patient, a former explorer, by \"Wwi name William. The worst he had proved to his heart with refer  ence to Henry he there and then transferred to the very eligible William, a man out-powering the boy in words circa 10,000:1. There took place a scene. Mischievous do laughed and eluded him among the tables. The feasting com  pany roared encouragements and banged with their spoons. Caspar groaned, called on Jesus and beat his own head with his fists. Cressyde ran down the corridor and hid herself in a female lavatory, beseeching her with kicks and thump  ings on the insubstantial door to emerge he was taken at a run by the institution's Immediate nesponse Squad (IRIS) and confined for twenty-four hours in the 1 *cked ward with the wild men. Is Bedlam now what it was in the old Queen's day? Roar  ings, cakes of shit? Caspar: n is not. They sit there slumped around the walls for the most part silent, or mutt  ering perhaps, Caspar the new boy apathetically eyeing; and \n￼if they outburst and roll on the floor in the old style or bounce from wall to wall like bluebottles, it is not for long. When Caspar woke it was dark. Nightmares were going the rounds, the visited s1eepers sobbed and groaned. He believed that jo would buy her freedom with the oblat  ion of her body to Dr Mcwarara, a young and powerful consul  tant. He, uaspar, would stay confined until he was geriat  ric. I smile at his foolish fears. Here he is now, free as the rest of us, and still nobbut a boy. How and when was he enlarged? Next morning in the quietest way. After break  fast however, during which he wept and trembled, he ran away into the farthest corner of the grounds and, close to the wall, on autumns of leaves, lay down, missing his dog. There Jo found him, and put her bitten fingers flat on his burn  ing eyes. Had they known where the dog was they would have scaled the wall at once and made another dash for the West  ern ern seaboard. Instead they lay ufSfer the leaves kissing. When they woke it v/as under ironic eyes. That afternoon Caspar was transferred to the hospital in the city. It was now, if ever, that his career as a penman might have got under way. I give him a ministry biro and indic  ate a goodly margin on last Friday:s bloody news, biting his tongue he prints his letters: Jo. Go on, I say. DEAR, he writes. And yourself, my boy? CASPAR. And nothing else? I say, no little doing word, no active feeeling in four let  ters? Crosswords, says Pat, I knew a man in Rochdale wouldn't come out till he\u2019d finished. Was he an educated man, Patsy? I ask, had he had good teachers? Like me and you to look at, Nobby, but he had a mind for words, his one possession was a pocicet dictionary given him by a Roman Catholic priest, in lieu of bread. -^11 he ever stole was paper and pencil, and always from the big stores that could afford it, never from little family businesses. What word, he would ask you without warning (you might be deep in your own thoughts, scrutinising the day\u2019s fancy or shivering and shaking for your early morning steadier), what word, he'd say, and I can see his black eyes shining, cocksure that he'd catch you out, wh t word in the English language, his finger up like this- not quite like that, old chap, I interrupt, not crooked and stiff as a claw... What good are they, Pat? asks Bassett. Raking the ashes with, that's about all. A widow's backscratcher, p murmur. Or for hanging little balls Sf \n￼on at Christmas time, says Stetson, ev^is_sarrT>a+rtrc>- But you v/ere saying, Pat, about the man from Rochdale, what word in the English language, he was asking... ABSTEMIOUS, says Pat, still looking at his fingers, all the vowels, you see, in their proper marching order. He died of the jake. And another thing was palindromes, the backsy-forsy words. REVIVER was one of the best he'd ever hit on, I re  member. But Caspar, once he'd mastered JO and CASPAR and DEAR and the four-letter feeling and doing word, there was no stopping him, he wrote them on his jacket, of hussar blue, on the backs of his hands, on the knees of his faded denims and even, once, across his forehead, boldly and blind  ly. This last inscription, when he ran to see it, appeared to him most strange. I take him by the hair across the table, smooth out his brows, as I might a beloved son; but regul  ation soap and water or the winds and rains of heaven or his sweat or a back of the hand full of snot and tears have obliterated his statement to the world. However, after years of practice on his proper person, our friend appealed to the authorities for a sheet of paper and with some help from half the laughing ward composed a communication to his sweetheart in the country. The envelope? Buff-coloured, such as directions from a government ministry come in, panic- striking. The stamp? Magenta, head of our sovereign, his penis not in sight. How sealed? With a lick, then with a loving kiss. Addressed? problem this. What surnajme she bore or patronymic he was ignorant of, and doubted whether she was not either, it never having emerged between them in their whispered, giggling conversations, nor ever passed from mouth to mouth when kissing, nor ever, through his tears and grinding teeth, in jealous rage. 'Lostling' remembered its  elf to him, and he was foolish enough to speak it. That she yjas the bastard daughter of a famous bandsman then seemed proved, and the hilarity was general. It was a sister of mercy finally (at the thought of whose laundered and ironed whiteness my ancient mischief stirs) who wrote in a lovely copperplate under his JO the address of the hospital of her whereabouts and bade him keep his pecker up, it would find her, there was only one, or if there were more than one only one could expect a communication coming from where his came from and bearing the name of his true love in such strik- \n￼ing simplicity. Tell us more of this gentle sister, Caspar. What most sticks in your mind of her charity? Her finger, going along the helpfully large letters in^/primcr for five year olds, its perfect shell-like nail unbitten, un  blessed by bleeding stepmothers either side, the whole hand (turning a page and flattening it for his laborious perusal) of a consistent beauty, not a finger on it, nor on the pair, any less than perfect, ,/e agree, with only Danny dissenting, that when all is said and cone there is nothing in the world quite like a good or even a bad woman1s hands. Danny thinks the hands of Tiger Smith, clenched at the weigh-in, or of Edge, tightening on an Apache throat, take some beating; but from both sides of the table, indeed from all four corners of the long room, come overwhelming instances of woman's super  iority in the matter: salting and vinegaring the chips, says Cack; ironing your shirt, says Bassett, tears in his lugubrious eyes; giving the breast to your firstborn son, or even your second- and your thirdborn, says Stan  ley, out of his curl of pain. This moves us greatly. Fingering your cock, says Desperate Dan. This even more. I daresay we should have run on in this vein all day, but our Captain, whom we respectfully forb«e to ask for the instance closest his heart (I fear none might occur to him) rouses us with a cry: To the morgue, my lads. I have news this very morning- he waves a long envelope- that we are a nose, or shall we say (and his old eyes twinkle) a in front of our nearest competi  tors in the packing stakes. Another thrusu, and we shall be a yard ahead. Moreover, our boys in the WD tel] me in confidence, but I sh .re the news with you, my dears, that the first cargo fell on the unsuspecting blackmen last Friday and any day now our brave soldiers in the field (bless 'em all) should be reaping the benefit, in the form of lavish hospitality- these savages know how to put on a spread- of our unstinting efforts back here on the home front. We cheer, he seems to want us to. rile out. Caspar, I say, a f itherly arm around his shoulders, those were anxious days for you, were they not, once the S'? \n￼letter had gone and you remained in the wards waiting for an answer. Did you lose your appetite or did you, as some do, nervously eat far more than usual? xhe latter. And did you find a lavatory through the barred window of which, standing on the toilet seat, you could observe the drive whereup every morning, regular as clockwork, v/histling a traditional air, the postman ped  alled? I did. Poor child. I suppose you imagined he would carry yours separately tucked in the band of his captor by some other means, a grin on his kindly'- face perhaps, signal to you at your window whitely staring th .t he had spotted her infant writing on a grubby envelope? It all went to the office. Whence came, after a lapse of weeks, your conviction that they had intercepted her letter, or more than one perhaps, for perhaps she had, being skill  ed in the art, written repeatedly, and out of spite or in your best interest (as they understood it) they hd/decided to cut your connecting threads of love with of icial shears. Prowlings outside the of ice door; an attempt, hopelessly bungled, to burgle the place at dead of nighx; your refusal to listen to reason. And the sister of mercy, she of the lovely fingers, could she not persuade you? Persuaded, you would have needed more consolation than a world of sisters of mercy, working overtime, could give. Thwarted was one thing, forgotten another. / 58 \n￼13 Yes, I say, it seems the :j«■n in Whitehall got their homework wronp. Our little block fri'-mis went ovc\" to Jehov -h ears ago and any rne.nt.ion of tin old Join T;ioinas is hanging .natter, xhe Christmas boxes we1ve been bombarding 'em with nave -iven great offence. Oux* fighting men got the cold shoulder when they finally made contact in their jungle greens. In fact, several of 'em were lynched by zealous mobs. The tribes have signed an with the opposition wholesale. Fancy, the Widow says. Yes, I say, Stetson's right for once, fever trust a man in pinstripes, they're all crumb-bums. 1 beg your pardon, Marquis: present company exceoted. Heads must roll for this, says Stets  on, but you can bet your boous there'll be the usual whitewash. Could they not drop them somewhere el e? the Marquis asks. I can't believe the phallic principle has gone out of favour the world over. Seems the unemployed are to get one each in their Or tlx stockings and that will disoose of five/inillion, but what's to be done with the rest is anybody's guess, they over-catered of course, there's mountains of 'em in every major city. We labour  ed in vain and that's the long and short of it. What a shame, says Mrs Clack. Yes, it's back to the old routine, but the fun's gone out of it. Fun, what fun? Life's flatter than ever, I mean. Never thou  ght we'd miss sitting in the morgue all day, but those were jolly times when you weigh up. Oh, anything but the present, the Marquis says. Well, there was Cacky cranking his little heart out, and yours truly had been entrusted with the choice of music and the management of the arm since our \u2018\"riend Norman was called to high  er things, xhe Captain nodded off more often than nou and we sat there nattering and woke him in time for the next refreshraents. Not at all a bad life when you look back on it.Jsome of us were glad to be doing our bit in however small a way. How's the Captain taken it? the Widow asks. Jiadly, worse than any of us. Hone of his fault of course, but he feels he's let us down. Stanley was sickly that morning and when the Caotaiu came out with the bad news the noor felluw laid his head on his arms and coughed until we thought we'd lost him. He's had ill the hump  ing t> do. It's broken y m r heart, old chap, the Captain said- &©■ hsjsu He acted up a bit, any man would, out his health has suffer- ^06 \n￼1 I 107 ed, no doubt about it, getting op a sweat v/ith the boxes and then sitting around in the cold, it was below freezing most d vs, you could toll by Patsy's nose. There was some discussion of what we might do instead, stetson wo all for raising a priv  ate army »ike the one in .valkden, but the Uantain said that venture had ended in catastrophe and he'd had a directive on no account to attempt anything of the sort. There was some grumbling of course, but you know what the ads are like, they'll settle for anything in the end, they don't mind how they oass the time so long as it oasses and they're not in too much pain and the meals keen coming round. Besides, we saw the Captain was unset, and oy and large who wants to see him miserable? So we put a brave face on it. The daily round, Captain, I said, the common task... it's not with  out its dignity. V/e were happy enough in the old days tearing up newspaper and counting the tins of rat poison, v/e can go back to that. They also serve etc. Well, thank you, Nobby, he said, I'm grateful to you for giving the others a lead in gen  erous resignation. I was afraid there'd be ructions. I helped him down and we shut up shop. Cack fetched his barrow for the gramophone and came back again for Stanley. The lads trooped out and the Captain and 1 dragged the heavy doors to and locked them with his rusty key. Poor King Kong, 1 said to myself, lying there in Thousands. Yes, says the Widow, I shouldn\u2019t like to be left in a morgue with all the conversat  ion and the music gone and nobody for company. Only the rats and the mices, missus, and the pigeons and the spiders, wood lice nerhaos in the damper places, centipedes and beetles no doubt, bats on occasion, but nothing human, nothin,\u2019 with any respect for royalty. Why can't he get you making something? Bowles asks, now that the idea's there. I'.m rather out of touch myself, but there must be things our boys could do with about the camo that you could manufacture if you'd a mind to. We had a neat idea for our Well  ington boots when I was in the Boys' Brigade, sticks in the ground, that's all it was, and the sticks went up inside the wellies so the solos were facing the sky, that way no ^ain got in, y >u could make the sticks, and v/e hung our enamel m ngs on hits of twi , T remember, it'd save our . men valuable minutes to hove t ose gadgets ready made by ca- unemp\":oyed back home. i \n￼There's iJor-s:in still, l say, he's not !nid off w ^ -Vo were sittin : i■ound ru.-xt moaning over a late or alefast, you kmov/ the scene, ninety orrcon I, of t.e inmates >r goo : as unconscious, heads in the slops, air ru could cut with a. knj^e, t ou-'h ;ot with one of ours, when in comes nor..an, Mold  in' a tray. Some coffee f,or the Doctor, please, he says, you conns at a loose end are you? And that without any sneer in his voice, but Albert took offence, he flares un at the least thing, dee, hee, says Took, of all the tarts to lose your h-ad over he chooses her. The man's an. idjut, Walter says. I saw them together in the market place this afternoon. I was there for the carol singing. They were arm in arm. 1 tell you, Mrs Clack, they were liketwo children, hove in its first flush very often has a -ejuvenating effect, in my experience. Che was wearing check trousers and a natty bow tie and a togetrier mace a smart and attractive appearance, Have a look clone up, says the Widow, it's marked inher face what vice has done to her, there's no losing that, agood conscience is worth more to a woman than oceans of oil of oolay. How right you are, Mrs Clack. V/e11, I did take a look close up. I was the worse for drink, I regret to say, and . . _ more/than a man should be by the oom-pah-pah of the Sally Ann Sand and all the good people singing. Albert and his Miss Fortune 'were in conversation with a. young Christian who is building hirnself a shack against the church in which to spend Christmas in conditi ns approximating, he imagines, to those enjoyed by our brothers, and sisters in parts of the world less fortunate than ours, a nice enough young man, already smoke-blackened, his teeth however white and «HU< 4 smiling. He had begun to cook his evening^rice in an old tin can and Albert and Mo, standing with him in the choking smoke, the municipal Christmas tree behind them, made a picture that would have cheered up anyone\u2019s bleak mid winter. There's more headcases running about loose in this city, says ..'alter slowly, than this man here- he indicates Took- has drunk pints. Be that as it may, I went up close;. tipped rny hat to miss Fortune and clapped Albert on the shoulder in the friendliest fashion. Smell  ing the drink, he was very stern with me . but could not prevent me from looking his good lady full in the face. She blushed, I hope. Her expression, Mrs Clack, was on- of utter defencelossness, and I dropped my gaze. Her cy>-r, arc sad and fat  igued, like a clown's, I can picture Her in a bowler. It is 108 \n￼]09 ten days since she touch cl strong d 'ink a.d at toe sight of h r fragility I resolved never to r isa the piedge myself. Concern ing Albert, th< lvirquif says, t ore's son* t.ing I'm very curious to know. Is in- or is he not ignorent o' his lady's most notorious bacchanale? He is not. You may take it from, me, t.'iere Is nothing ho does not know, fly warmth t wards them both under the windy Christmas tree was in nart relief to see them not dissevered. U 's a faithful sweetheart, soys the Widow, unlike some others who shall be ameless, but all I can say is: he deserves something better than that drunken ooer. As though lie hadn't got enough on his plate, struggling to put him  self right, without taking her on as well, who knows? I say. But if the matter were to be discussed as it ought to be,we should soon be into areas of human behaviour it is not fit for people to be in in mired company (our rtr ;ig-1y budciing\u2014fonce,\u2014at varimer heightLS., from little Cork tn mighty.SIim;\u2014all\u2014-hapoo rrftd\u2014sizes, 'k.ai~^JLQr \u2014ef\u2014'em-up to hoop-la,\u2014alno ;\u2014tnough rn\u2014Dm milk  maid busied ri^rc!p1f ~\u2014■L 1\u2014t.hp liuie.) and I suggest we return to Norman, a topic as likely as Albert ro interest and inspire and less likely to offend. And yet, says the Marquis, his troubles, so I believe, stem largely from his relations with the opposite sex. True, but tnat is in the background or on the periphery of our interest and it would be as idle as it would be prurient to pry there; he concerns us now in his dealings with one of his ov/n sex, viz.:the mysterious Doctor Condon. / Busy are you, ivonan? the courteous Dougie enquired, what page you on? I never see the numbers, Norman said, he puts all the pages face down, but the pile's _ six inches high. Wish I could get myself fixed up like you, the Grampus whined, he's a gentleman, the Doctor, y m can see it in the way he dress  es, he'll look after you, Norman, he's not like one of us, he's had an education, you can see it in the way he talks, he's had the-breaks as well, mind, I left school before I'd rightly settled in, my father drank, you know, something terrible, and my main was on the game. You don't say, said atetson- he and the Grampus have never hit it off- you don't say. You hear that, lads? His father drank and his mammy was on the game and he never had no education. You don't say. That explains a lor. I'd never have guessed. You've done wonders really to make it this far after a start like thar. You're right, Grampus, Norman said, the Doctor's a remark- \n￼able man and I thank my lucky stars that he ever looked my way. I suppose my schooling v/as not much more thorough than yours, old chap, and yet itere I am assisting him with his magnum o .us. And he shook his head. There's not a ha'porth of conceit in that man, says the V/idow, he's a saint. A nutter, says Walter. A holy fool, says the Marquis. Well, whatever he is, I say, he went on to toll us, since he can't keep secrets, that once the v/riting v/as finished and the typescript in the impacient hands of its publisher, they v/ere going travelling, he and the Doctor. There's a lot of the world he wants to see yet, .orrr.an said. See? said Stetson, how's he mean -see'? The man's blind. Manner of speaking, I suggested. But lor/nan was blushing. I'm his eyes, he said, he says I'm his eyes. I've to tell him what sights we pass, always in a low voice, he can't abide loud voices. I've to speak softly and tell him what there is to see, now on the left side, now on the right, and now straight ahead. And if it's a sight especially worth seeing, if the guide book gives it a star or even if in my opinion it's worth a longer look, then i've to pull up and wind the window down and turn his face towards it. He can feel colours with his cheeks, he says, and he'll leave it to me to fill in the details. We're doing a scenic ride ar  ound the Gower first, that's a part he's never seen before, he says. I'm reading up about it, I got a book from the Public Library. That afternoon, the Captain still absenting himself, we fell into the hands of the gatemen. They are of the opinion that idle  ness is bad for us. They broke in with the dogs during siesta time and organized a football match for every man not in possess  ion of a Matron's exemption. Patsy was Left on the field of bat  tle, I'm afraid, v/hich is why he can't be here tonight. Look busy, says the narquis, Ruje Number One in any institution. Your average warder can no more abide anotner man's idleness than Mother Nature can a vacuum. He'll rush to fill you in. Yes, our own Little Hitler was -certainly much happier once we were all out there in trie drizz  le running up and down. He gave Blood a biscuit, 1 noticed, and cracked jokes with his colleagues. I should have liked to see the rnaxch, says the Marquis. Did Bassett p1ay? did the u-rampus? Both, after t eir fashions. Stan  ley collapsed, poor fellow. He's exempt good and pr per now. The one bright s-ot was a visit fr m the Canon with a fine-looking woman in tow.

Lady, I said, you'll no doubt be wondering hov/ we get like this, how v/e ever in the^span of a measly lifetime sink so ' far as to become v/hat you see us to be. Let me correct at the outset a misconception which I am afraid, knowing his line, our friend the Archbishop may have out to you. Drink is not the cause of our condition but only a symptom. If not the drink, then v/hat? She shook her head. Love, I said, \u2019.'o word of a lie, Mrs Clack, she gripped her handbag as though her life were in it, and what big eyes she made. She licked her lips. Yes, I said: love, too much or too little. Generally the latter, generally a crushing exces\" of the latter, but in my case, interestingly, a mixture of both. Let me explain... Jesus, says Bowles, you didn't g. into all that, did you? I made a start, I say, it was a bit of a gallop, I can tell you, 1 plunged in at r ndora, hop  ing to recapitualte as I advanced, but . of course there wasn't time, so all she got was bits and pieces, not wholly ineffectual however, 1 venture to think. Madam, I said, were you yourself, I wonder, ever torn between duty and desire? Deed I ask? Who that is human was not? On the one hand, say, marriage and its sacred vows, and on the oAther,tporkops t whctr-ho-vo for tho logctl *-V JT' ng that bosom of yours, v/hat sighs and heavin:s, sobs in the throat, «>«./ moist h-anria- and wrung hands, eh lady?

It v/as in such a oredicament 1 founo myself at a time of my life when I still might have taken a decisive turn for the better. For the better? -'or the best, ^ady, you would not ;hink it to look at me now, but there was a time when if the Angel of the Lord had come down to me in ^ereon and offered me carte blancne- go on, anything you like, the sky's the limit, tin Old Man's in a giving mood- 1 should have sent bin back t ) Heaven with a grateful hot-to half is no- |uJUL «3 Me \n￼Ir shake of the head. And the cause >f I.is felicity? A woman. (Deed we ask?) a mortal woman, such *. y,)U are you ■self, lady, though less ful 1 about the bosom, you' II not mind my saying so, and rather less kempt, and also, I *n» o offence by this, she had the advantage over you in years- at the time in q/uestion, U-r k.a/fW ^ 0\" course, not now, now you'd kw-er^I*.ru^=t=»»e f-her in t;at respect, she's overtaken you long since, gone over the hill, gone under the hill for all I know, an- yourself not three quarters of the way up, I shouldn't t ink, and plenty ahead of you still of delicious vacillation between duty an. desire. Marriage of course is a powerful awa i.ner of a woman's deepest feelings and if their first and legally sanctioned object proves himself, after oo<we lapse of time, to be unworthy of them, why, some transfer is very likely; for^oner, conjured up_,how shall they, so to speak, be got back into the bottle again? That's enough of that, says the Widow. What she stood for I don't know, but I do . know what JI.

I meant no more than £he disposition on the lady's part, I reply, and also, but Mrs Clack won't have us go on with this, 1 was aDout to suggest that doing without what you've grown to like isn't al  ways easy and might subject the precepts of even the best of women to some strain. Anyway, enough. 1 got no further with the Pride of the mothers' Union, either; for the jealous Canon, seeing his fancy piece had eyes only for me, suddenly abandoned the right wing, where he had been exerting himself without her aphLause, and intruded his glistening counten  ance into our tete-a-tete. Mr Horn entertaining you, I see, he said, lake him with a pinch of salt. I was explaining to this good lady how we get like we are, 1 said. Her knuckles were wnite, so hard had she been gripping her precious nag. Drink, said the Canon, drink and onanism, in many cases Hereditary, alas. we pray, we do our best.

She does donkey rides for the kiddies in the senson, the boy could have helped, earned an honest bob or two. We had hardly begun. What be  came of Jo, the lostling, the waif and stray? And his early life, v/e hadn't got'bn to that.
