He crosses the celestial ocean as helmsman of the world, called Aah, the vizier of Ra, the sun. He loads the gleaming boat with palm leaves which record the days and nights in notches, for he is the measurer of time, and he invented writing. He carries an ivory writing palette in his long black fingers, to instruct the scribes who squat before him on the sand. And he helps them on their later journey through the Night Of A Million Years as Thoth, the protector of the dead: he takes them kindly by the hand and guides them through the underworld; his nine baboon musicians line the long bank where the travellers pass on their way to Osiris, dreaming of playing draughts with the gods and dancing with them in the Field of Reeds. \n￼Hill Trembling 10-24 3/2/94 12:54 pm e 13 Mr Bonnet, did you meet him, and will I, when I step on board the silver barque? Will he be saying Pleased to meet you, Airs Hill, and how\u2019s the writing going? as we descend the corridors of night into the Judgment Hall. Will he pat me on the shoulder with his cracked avuncular hand and, tucking my book inside his sky-blue cape, will he wink before he picks his tail up and climbs onto his special perch above the scales? -& ","docTitle":"","docDate":"1994-03-02"},"meta":{"contentType":"text/raw","emVer":"7.1.1103.5","langIdVer":"DefaultLangId","processingVer":"CalaisJob01","submissionDate":"2014-07-01 09:53:22.147","submitterCode":"57b17a53-6e34-87b0-20ff-a419896f49c9","signature":"digestalg-1|sxiJnhDApCqKXttnNo2REcN0c70=|GYRUmd8+iyZhIKGMeIzWTuvE3a8pOiD8kJKqzJiolmK/0k0Ih7iiyQ==","language":"English"}},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/81e63190-e1ac-3e24-aa98-3423bc283dcf/lid/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http://d.opencalais.com/lid/DefaultLangId/English"},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/e911da6b-56e4-3544-9357-5d79d01c1538":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"Position","name":"author","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/Position","instances":[{"detection":"[ Designs and Patents Act 1988 to be identified as ]the author[ of this work.
