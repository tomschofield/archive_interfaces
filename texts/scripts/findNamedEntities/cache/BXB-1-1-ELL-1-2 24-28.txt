Those were the sixth-form days, □ the thrill of the start of the mind's future: books, plays, G theories of love and sex, the birth of articulation; and you Q shining like an emblem, a hazy great emblem, of life Q waiting me across the fields with all its promises. For to walk Q down your aisles under hedges of flowering glass; to inspect □ pompous Latin tombs, grey slabs of chill Norman floor, or review □ the screen's line of Gothic kings % was part of a gigantic romance, □ the threshold of a plot starring me,university and women. Q You were all that York was not: 4r outside, bikes and coats, muffled greys Q of city life; here, no arcade, no vista of columns, that she □ hadn't just left, trailing elusively a trace of brown hair; no footstep □ behind, where I didn't turn to see the sudden absence of her shape. )«:---- II All the same, you Gothic bitch, Qyou were always aloof, impassive; thousands like me Qhave come with conspiracies \u2022and your clean stone soars enormous, D washed of us all. 4 Or you teamed against me: G middle-class club, owned and staffed by middle classes, Q like the women I wanted you were clear and cool, well-bred, □ stocked with silver; * 33*---=> bceaXc \n￼your spaces rang with trained voices, Q choir of boy sopranos, Oxbridge priests: ray dreams focussed Q into having the dean's daughter on the soft, green close Q while the organ pounded midnight mass. i. ULi 1ts- -III 44 Oh, I knew that 'heart of Yorkshire1 stuff: Qcoach-loads of Leeds grannies, outings from west-riding mills, claiming Q their place inside a people's church; and sometimes like a people's lad Ql've arsed about under your eaves. Nights of disco's and drinking in York: Q girls, fish and chips and kisses tasting of vinegar Qon a bench by the west front: ¥ to look at arc-lit limestone Qand saints nodding down from ogees makes a pretty interval Qin bouts of furious smooching; when unknown perfumed armpits □ and breasts damp from dancing and Decorated architecture Qmix into moments of glory. You took me, like a neutral mother, O in all ray adolescent shapes, whether I fingered female crevices Qor, studious, your own carving, always the same, always radiant; Qand if I'd sunk completely your smile wouldn't have changed, Qyour shining supervision of York. 1X71 IV Then these notes changed to sober ijthe gradual decline of growing up.

Visiting York in vacations jpl felt like my own ghost, stumbling between past and future, £3not seeing our separation begin: you just leaked away £3 during a decade of hard work.

D So we swapped lives: I could look at your lovely body Qand feel unmoved as stone. \u2014v Now past thirty I approach you again, Qtrying a new language, trying to make up; settling for □a placid, easily worn relationship, a no-hard-feelings Ohow've-you-kept truce; congratulating you on another year O in your permanence, with wishes for the next five hundred; Oand since you ask, while our paths were parting fjl've done quite well: I love my wife, though not as I'd expected; Dl likemyjob though it isn't what I thought; Oand existence - well, it's not the Gothic garden Ql once knew, * being young, in the 60s, in York. □ You should learn that too: I read last month of the party, Dyour great roof down, butt-ends of beams all over the floor Q smoked by the storm. * The time's gone for glory blazgs, Q so follow after me: I used to love storms, run mad .

In the front the motto-crowned ladder of signatures shows the notes on the poems are Dorothy's, a few soft scrawls in the margins in the same loose hand as her name: ancient wisdom she'd taken down to knit into essays and hand back in. I can see the classroom as she writes: the dense weight of a pre-war summer drenching the rows of bent heads, a teacher talking and a pen scratching what I read now: 'Death's inescapability', 'the illusion of hope'; and with hopes of sloughing gymslips for evening-gowns, 'a poem that shows the inadequacy of Love'. good to get marks with but useless for life? that she enjoys life still: the old dear living next door seems happy enough and might be her. Her son's down now: his car in the drive, the rose-bushes scrupulously circled with plots of lawn, it all looks fine: just as if a child had carefully built the street from a kit (yet mightn't be trusted not to get bored).
