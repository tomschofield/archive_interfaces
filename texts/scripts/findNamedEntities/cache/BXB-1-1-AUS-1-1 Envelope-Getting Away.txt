I should also like to thank the staff of Cambridge Polk Nuseum for the information about Elizabeth Woodcock on which the poem 'Snowcase - Versions' is based. / \n￼ONLOOKERS We have our own concerns \u2014 as the snail on the stem inexorably slides on its one foot upward, despite the dragon arriving between the winter trees. We forage likewise for what feeds our particular lives: the wild roots in the forest or a lover's look above the table, that continues, drinks our eyes. So, when the soldiers came and did not take our men with them out to the pits already dug with pickaxes in the almost-frozen ground, we followed at a distance, dim ghosts between the trees, giving our half-attention to a lack of winter gloves when the shots of the many hunters shook our watching. t \n￼HARD RAIN Is it birdshot among the branches? A pheasant has broken three window-panes in panic up\u2014flight from the garden. The thin grey cat arrests its hunting. Pigeons clatter in the wood that is too far from my sleeping to give the sound of rain on leaves I heard last night. Its softness recalled drops against the skin, a spaced wet speckle like that barring pheasant feathers I took from the corpse in the garden the cat or foxes had emptied into bones and birdshot. Branches clatter in the January wood. \n￼BA.CK TO BACK 1 The wind in the leaves does not go on all the same; there is the in-breath, the out-breath, like sleepers'.... The train stopped between stations, I hear the breathing trees, thick either side the track in fullest summer. The sleepers crowd my carriage. Still as images I see them in their marriage beds - two by two, back to back, dreaming of other people. One wakes for a moment, to the moon against her eyelids, hears the rhythm of his breath and lapses back into her own. The man beneath her lashes moves without suspiration, more transparent than the air playing before the moon. A tree next to my window turns up all its leaves at once in a pale-green shudder, a sudden breath. The train goes on. \n￼2. My eyes feed here, this is their grazing ground - your face, your outline coming from a distance, one hair on the back of your hand. It is good pasture, like some water meadow, and I fatten. This is the way that flesh is grass: I eat and never use you up, turn at the hedge to start again; the brain breeds further stock - these languorous tranced cattle, chewing the cud of you and you and you. Enough of metaphor gone on too long, delighting in itself. I like to look at and to think of you, seeing your profile clear against a wall, watching you stride the corridor until you're small and then you're out of sight. And that's the sum of it.... It is enough to fodder me through winter. I \n￼3. It's crazy the way I think of you in cycles: as though your incandescent face rose like the moon on an appointed day; like the moon,had its phases marked in pocket diaries; hung like the moon in my uncurtained window, needling its light through eyelids into sleep... or else was absence, its brightness wiped, as the filled circle on a blackboard to stand for the fullest moon can be turned to a dark hollow and then to blank again, while outside, across a thicker sky, the invisible satellite trundles; and I think of neither, my diary's shaded rounds just so much clutter, you in a deeper space, obscured by I don't know what, I don't know why. / \n￼( 4. Match me, oh match me! Thumb to thumb and eye to eye, our mirror hands equivalent to mirror contemplation, dreaming. I sicken in the solitude. The one glove lost. One found and stuck up on a railing in the rain. Wool mats, the fingers curl in to the palm. The uselessness of that - one glove alone. Throw it away. Hands close upon each other like the two halves of a shell. We are no more than shapes of hands. A pair of gloves. Skin does not contact skin. Tumbled together in a drawer, we wear the chastity of clothing, dream ourselves to one.... At least I dream. And crave your mirror dreaming.... Match me in the darkness, bright against the black. t \n￼r 5. Struck wild above the lake by a seven-eighths moon, the bats make a quick, quick lace in the air with their flickering passage. The moon brightens. The lake lies down. Bats weave and weave, too fast for my following eye that tries to hold one long enough to see its face of a flittermouse. A missel thrush hops in the dust; but I note the original little dinosaur - that throat of spotted feathers turned easily to scaled skin. The white moon climbs the sky. I mount a slope beyond the sleeping lake. A rabbit, startled, rocks away then sinks and watches, rocks and sinks and watches me. How white its scut in the thickening dusk, how bright underneath the moonJ / \n￼MOON Kepler, through his lenses, felt a breath of faint warm on him from the moon; surely like this one, a puncture of glow just past the horizon, strip-teasing with wisps of plumbago cloud.. I am restless under it, seeing you exact and tiny in the distance, working in lumberjack's shirt as the dream showed. Mr Muse, you keep doing this to me: appearing above a horizon to alter the heat and illumination here, unsettling what was quiet and decided just before - as the moon does, turning gardens from green to blue-and\u2014white neon like a nightclub. \n￼I've always been sensible, but I'm trying to give that up and let the risky in, to pepper myself with its holes, becoming a colander person - to put it lightly. To put it heavily requires a different motion - shift of weight from hip to hip, foot to foot, elbow, wrist and fingers - and goes on doing so unto the postponed ending. I prepare for that ending each time I visit you: greedy at the eyes, but reticent and still sensible in hands and mouth and torso - and anyway, preparation is some advisable thing devoid of openings, those holes in metal, this mouth as it should be, spittle shining on the teeth in the light of your room where the window is flung wide. The world grows meaner, smaller, clenching its holding fist: I try not to be mean here, not to retreat or close, drawing niy snai1-horns in and sealing the shell door behind me; my body is all the weight of that single mollusc foot pressing the ground, sensibly, hanging on, not launching itself on the air as other creatures do, those heroes in my book for emulation. \n￼( / TETTIN'l AWAY Houdini in the knots, the rope going one hundred times around, in a hemp tube or sack straight-jacket - easy, a doddle; even the chains slip loosely, loudly down tomakearing aroundyourshoes.... IfIwerewith you,Iamnotsure I could do it: I would crack at the lungs in the tank of water,my hands stilltied, or lose the race with the fire at thecable's end, letting you down in the act in front of an audience.
