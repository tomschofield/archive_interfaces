Think I\u2019ll smash up all your poxy jam jars crammed with rice & lentils, with those woeful ADUKI beans Later, like the speaking clock, you\u2019ll still be prattling down here oblivious in the debris, while I\u2019ll be upstairs fmuttering PROPERTY IS THEFT in you/lavish bathroom or maybe upturning beds hunting out Daddy\u2019s pricless antique knick-knacks, hurling them with glee like paper planes, aiming them straight at your sensitive cats with their pretentious names, as they skulk in the yard near the patio door... 24 0 \n￼Cleary 23-52 13/7/93 6:50 pm Page 25 Disneyland We\u2019re just cruisin through the afternoon two cans of lager *1 syrd a spliff on the roof the police down below on secret manoeuvres don\u2019t frighten me! may as well be pandas frolicking may as well be plastic men quick!

Now she\u2019s sitting here with me. We talk over separations, how much they cost. I\u2019ve frayed with years but she still clings to delicacy. Her fragile wrist reaching for lager, her raised arms speaking deliberate messages. I notice how the bikers in the corner still want her. It\u2019s plain from the grimace each wears on his face, she\u2019s still in fashion. If I could read their lips they\u2019d mutter to each other in unkempt voices, What\u2019s she doing with that asshole? 25 \n￼Cleary 23-52 13/7/93 6:50 pm Page 26 Drugs Pleasure takes years to perfect a room draped with Indian cloth, the hearth that feeds on Rizla scraps & ash. One more hot knife before you go stumbling into the sodium glare babbling aloud. Grounds of Asylum I\u2019ve seen them often as I cross the lawn, their dishevelled committee meeting beneath drooping branches. They sit on benches bestowed to them by last century\u2019s gentlemen. Strange, I should always notice their white stubble, how short they wear their cast-off trousers. Murmuring, they always seem to stare like nomads to an aimless distance. Indeed from over here, in the new block they could be mistaken for scarecrows flapping their arms at pigeons. I laugh when I see them on trains or buses, disrupting clerks or shoppers, ranting about Vikings. Their grinning faces always make me want my childhood back. 26 \n￼Cleary 23-52 13/7/93 6:50 pm Page 27 \\ 'I Home brew & video Turns out we could have made it to the speedway after all, but we just couldn\u2019t raise ourselves once we\u2019d settled down. Completely lethal stuff! I was scanning the papers with malice, next thing I know she\u2019d sprawled across me, cuddled up! I sneered at right-wing bias and she tittered, rising as usual to fiddle a bit with the knobs... Fallen Angels Then gulping rum in a desperate sweat my clothes strewn about me the dream of our freehold dissolves. Let\u2019s face it, Angel, we\u2019ll never connect. Hawthorn will still blossom but oblivious of us. We who belong to chemicals & bedsits, to these late-night bouts of self-destruction. So accept you\u2019ll never cause a scandal with outrageous skirts or hairdos, never turn the heads of frustrated farmers in the bars or chapels of the outback.

What\u2019s more, our unborn children, a whole fleet of them with names like Klee or Ophelia, will never run wild & undisciplined trampling the vegetable rows we\u2019ll never even try to nurture. Scratchmarks I\u2019ve heard toothpaste removes lovebites - at least a salesman I hitched from Knutsford Services told me so, ^ and he drove a Volvo with buttons to adjust reclining seats and headrests, so who was I to doubt? What I wanted to know, though was what would happen if his suspicious wife...
