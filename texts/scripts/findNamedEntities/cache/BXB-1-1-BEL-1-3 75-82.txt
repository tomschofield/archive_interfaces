A shiny hum of traffic with no pulse Along the concrete now. Time to un-pin Bravado, unfreeze tears, feel pain. We missed the mac of excitement In the old High treet, when it burned: Twenty-two years led up to this, a loss. Nineteen Eighteen, Armistice Day Waves of excitement thundered round my pram, The crowded skyline bristled in relief, Shops packed in narrow cliffs rang joy. But found no Ali Baba word to open The caves to small boys\u2019 lust, each heaven cut off - (A crimson wedge of steak, coffee to rape a nose, Vast scented lilies, lobsters, brandy-balls, Spectrum of ties from which to choose a week -) The angel plate-glass scolded lack of means, Banished a school-boy home - tea, homework, bed. So Speech Day willed a jeering oil to blister Forty distinguished Old Boys: the Mayor to be strung up. Militant ARMS FOR SPAIN boards down the High Street, And DAILY WORKER outside cinemas. (A fat old bald man sighed, \u2018Ah! Propaganda!\u2019 And livid neon smirked back from his brow. And all the Fifty-Shilling Tailors\u2019 dummies sneered). And after Munich put us into heat, We went on talking, walking up and down, A Saturday addiction, dear Unreal City! And ettfin Betjeman\u2019s slim volume came To prove to us we loved, about to lose; In small beer, posthumous, glowed wonted fires, Rake\u2019s progress to armed forces of the crown. 75 \n￼Not there, then, in the blast, when flames were eating. (My parents started walking out o f town.) Came back on leave, amazed, it was all gone, Nothing was where it was and all was wrong, And everywhere looked through to green of park, Vistas to statues or to distant spires. And scuttled, numb, to pubs still left. Bar Gate survived, as usual, with its air O f being left over from some other pageant, Waiting to be relieved by Ham the Fifth. Apres la guerre, the G.I. saw a slum, And wished himself in Naples or Berlin. We met again and told old stories, hastily Beat it for London, looked for jobs. It\u2019s rough that there\u2019s no moral comes from this, Only excuse for lack of roots. Where is the Phoenix? Surely there was burning. With more bravado still, some extra tears, We just accentuate a usual gap. Old stories for old friends, then shy away And pick up, elsewhere, what we can. 76 r \n￼Three Days A pleasant way to finish the war off At the convalescent Depot at Salerno, Scrounging, on the Education Staff - Run Quiz, Tombola, Brains\u2019 Trust in the NAAFI, Give left-wing lectures on the post-war world. Plenty of cheap, good, spirits in the Sergeants\u2019 Mess, And sea and time enough to swim off hangovers. Armistice, Italy, was a fine, fine day. We were awed and excited, suddenly free. Finito Tedesci. Finito Bourn Bourn. And no fear now To be sent up through squalid transit-camps To front-line mountains, snow and mud and bang. San^ the RED FLAG again, several times this time - Alex had brought it off before Montgomery - And a muscular Glaswegian R.S.M . Thumped on the bar and glinted through black brows: \u2018It\u2019s victorry for the lads. I\u2019m glad. I\u2019m glad It\u2019s victorry for the worrkers back at home.\u2019 We left the mess and went swimming, drunk in the moonlight. V.E. Day was a different matter, stale. Started drinking in the morning, went on all day, We\u2019d expected this so long, and O.K. this was it, We were rancid with expectation. And Churchill wireless-spoke, fatigued. What was it? Submarine bases, Ireland? What about demobilisation? And a red-cap sergeant, who nobody trusted, Lay groaning under a table: \u2018Four bleeding years! Churchill! Four bastard years and a half!. Churchill! etc., etc., etc.,\u2019 True but tedious, we thought. Next day got up with brass-sick mouth. We went about our duties, sullenly. V.J. Day I spent in Halifax, Yorks., Wilfrid Pickles\u2019 home-town, R.E. Depot. They had the gall to get us on parade \n￼7 78 For a major to tell us the war was over. It wasn\u2019t we weren\u2019t pleased the new invention Had finally finished things off. And no fear now etc. But there wasn\u2019t much celebration, there wasn\u2019t much beer in the town, And the locals wouldn\u2019t have a lot to do with us. They\u2019d had time to get used to soldiers, all through the war. \n￼Bell\u2019s Elegy The Bomb\u2019s been dropped again, in style, and how! Fat clouds are worried over the debris. A patch of blue sky stares. What happens now? Angels weeping, of course. Mainly for me. \n￼Ode to Psychoanalysis I I said to Doctor Hackenbush During abortive analysis, \u2018I hate the word, Love.\u2019 I meant parents\u2019 unhelpful concern, I meant they had to bring me up To work hard and do without money Just as they had: I had to be neat and industrious And flatter any bosses around With my modest ability to cope. II My penis was dangerous, dangerous, dangerous, Messy and dangerous, In danger o f being cut off. (My God, the ducks were quacking for it, And cocks ran round and round without their heads, My grandmother\u2019s cat chased a rabbit\u2019s tail on a string.) My bladder was sadder and madder and badder When I used to wet the bed. I remember a cold rubber sheet underneath. (Dear waters, please, bring back the Flood). My bowels were a sheer embarrassment, Holding back in white-faced spite, And then erupting generosity, A richness on a social afternoon... 80 \n￼I didn\u2019t get very far, acting it out With Doctor Hackenbush. I developed, he said, \u2018A massive negative transference,\u2019 So the analysis was cut off After I hadn\u2019t paid him For over two months - He took two-fifths of my wages. (His name wasn\u2019t Hackenbush anyway). I still wanted to kill Stalin After that. But I felt I\u2019d let Freud down. The cook would not run the State, And the State wouldn\u2019t wither away, And psycho-analysis Was very expensive indeed: Postpone, for the time being, The New Jerusalem. IV So here I am, in the middle of several paths, More or less where I\u2019ve always been Having survived war and intensive masturbation Getting away with murder, maybe But suffering Hell because I\u2019m always overdrawn At the bank whose manager hovers Clacking revengeful shears. Hey there! Nobbdaddy! That\u2019s my flaming sword... \n￼Manicure Each fingernail, ugly again, Must be clipped to a crisp moon. Ten homy wedges, A city\u2019s dirt under the edges, Could sharpen to ten weapons, Razors, flick-knives - mustn\u2019t happen. An urbane law, Not red in tooth and claw, Says what nails are for: Combing the eyebrows neady, Scratching the skin discreedy, Squeezing blackheads, scraping corns from toes, And picking one\u2019s nose. 82 \n￼I didn\u2019t get very far, acting it out With Doctor Hackenbush.
