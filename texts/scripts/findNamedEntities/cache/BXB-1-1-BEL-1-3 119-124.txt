ALVAREZ 1 Who scarred the editor and smashed his snitch? Which X-bard flashed a chiv, and which one wailed? Who snapped whose umbrella, then Tore down urinals, roaring? Who told whose mistress, in waltz-time He was out to get him? Which megalomaniac said, aggrieved, \u2018You\u2019rr the pushingest mon in poetrry today\u2019? Who needled whom Into hurling a glass of water? Who bashed up Pakistanis in the street? 2 Learn skills. Either the skill of a boxer And afford to be firm and forgiving Or deploy your sharp remarks From a barricade of horn-rimmed spectacles - That way you win your action for assault: And when you stab, stab always in the back. And pray for an unfailing hunch To know which pundit to take out to lunch. \n￼Ultimate Anthology Jacket it winsomely in primrose yellow! Here A, B, C are drained of words they said - Decendy wild now, each a handsome fellow, With X, and Y, and charming little Z. 120 t \n￼Footnote to Enright\u2019s \u2018Apocalypse\u2019 Cultivated Signals types During the campaign in Italy Used to tune sets in To German stations: \u2018The Nazis do Beethoven beautifully.\u2019 And one American boasted H e\u2019d caught Freischtjitz complete - Thus diminishing his boredom. (Our chief culture-martyr Was Glenn Miller.) The Tedeschi certainly bought Their magic bullets. What have we bought? What have we paid for? \n￼121 122 Couples Three couples in this bar, at different tables, Two old, one young: the partners are like each other. One has vegetable faces, chunky respectable Carrot or parsnip faces: they look fed up, Keep still, have company manners on: In private this breaks down, one hopes, suspects, In rootish laughter, wrinkled grins. The second is restless and furtive and tatty, Two mangey carnivores pacing one cage grey-pelted, He fidgets pipe, taps chin, her fingers flutter Round the gin she isn\u2019t drinking: They talk and talk, unsatisfied. The third couple is young, unworried, in good health - Skin, hair, teeth gleam like advertisements - They carry off their clothes as elegance - Speak in a lively manner, gesture like film-stars - For a few years now are privileged, boss-class. The girl, a bit plain beneath the glitter, Glances round at the others, Is troubled, briefly troubled, Intelligent under her hair-do. \n￼Anecdote November afternoon, misty at half-past three, Chrysanthemums still bright in slant of sun, And two small girls chattering along the pavement. The smaller said \u2018It was shepherds.\u2019 The larger, \u2018I know,\u2019 \u2018Praise him, praise him.\u2019 The other said \u2018No, IIt was shepherds.\u2019 At last it came to them And they sang through a verse in wobbling unison: \u2018The king o f love my shepherd is And he that doth mefeed... \u2019 Having accomplished this they shook off their Sunday School smugness, And trotted away like little animals. There was the mist getting close, getting closer. There was the sun, an acid slant of yellow. It had been warm and now was chill. Most uncomfortable weather. \n￼Dialogue corbiEre: The song of self-praise goes on, too long, too long. You\u2019ll have to sober up soon, old comrade, And live an ordinary boring day through. I died of TB at a foolishly early age - Why do you have to act so finicking hypochondriac? BELL: You never had to live with so much praise In pounds and shillings and pence. They riddle my vitals, painfully. It is not true that I am not in pain - You damned unlucky maudit poet, you And writing so well, blast you. 124 t ","docTitle":"","docDate":"2014-07-01 08:44:48.253"},"meta":{"contentType":"text/raw","emVer":"7.1.1103.5","langIdVer":"DefaultLangId","processingVer":"CalaisJob01","submissionDate":"2014-07-01 08:44:47.348","submitterCode":"57b17a53-6e34-87b0-20ff-a419896f49c9","signature":"digestalg-1|xKHXhaMDgFuT0egRPa7KobpgCy0=|FsOSLacOTIYuKXS/9K3uqsZ3t3cm8CVG1LoExGajLalnJpsJQ7z4Eg==","language":"English"}},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/5990dc3a-a355-3d60-8b5d-29a62b400408/lid/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http://d.opencalais.com/lid/DefaultLangId/English"},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/5b9e8343-33dc-34aa-b024-7923790fa68c":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"Position","name":"editor","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/Position","instances":[{"detection":"[__________ K \u2014 A.
