Clean lettering on a painted board sets out that Robert Frost had this pine home way back and way up North of Boston^ The tourist buggies rubber-wheel along behind calm horses; beds of herbs perplex the air in the noon sun. The grass is laundered, the trees tamed. This couldn\u2019t be New Hampshire, nor one of the five farms in Vermont. The woods are empty of promises, no one swings on the birches. Still, put your hand here.

LESS 5-fh Uoe 'posckrv^ned 15 \n￼New Orleans The moon hangs like the last cantaloupe on the market, in its net of cloud. Even at this small hour there will be some slung yet over quiet traders down that end of town. Music splutters out of the bars and falls into the streets, where tangles of people mooch and spread, their faces agleam like the potter}' carnival masks hilarious in the stores; they are glazed it seems armoured in joy. Out further, in the wide reaches of darkness, police-cars howl like sad cats and forage among shadows. There is a blood-scent on the grid. No night can be different. Later, the moon slips from its net and lifts, brightens into a white dominance, and pulls what could be hope, what feels like hope, necessary neutral illumination, along the glittering and enormous river. 16 / \n￼Oklahoma City Outside the Capitol Is the cowboy statue under the tree, With small shades dancing On the flanks of the once wild Pony gripped between his thighs. Over the road in open sun The derrick atop the oil-well Is a pyramid of glitter. It will have you frowning, Lowering your eyes. The cool museum\u2019s statue The End ofthe Trail Is white and gigantic. The ghost Indian slumps astraddle, The horse is collapsing like a snowbank. In the high-ceilinged room You can almost hear Their harsh, last breathings. \n￼Noon in Santa Fc High-nosed trucks with snorting upright pipes get between us and the Indians. They sit beyond the traffic with their spread jewellery, their bread big as pillows, their prune-pie, shaded under the colonnade. And about the plaza pale^splay-brimmed hats move pools of shadow slowly from awning to awning round the fawn adobe buildings, banks, offices, hotels, and girls are rollerskating silently, with elastic limbs and lifting, sun-bleached hair. Close, hard, knife-edged, the mountains jag into the sky, where a few blinding clouds, white as imagination, balance and stretch. It is as if something is waiting, some utterly undomestic possibility hangs in the blue. The air shimmers over the trucks\u2019 shaking engines. The heat is volcanic. 18 ","docTitle":"","docDate":"2014-07-01
