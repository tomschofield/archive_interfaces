(tel: 091-232 5988) \n￼Where were we then? Self-knowledge, wasn't it? How much? how little? A good thing or a bad? And wasn't it true we mostly only scratched the surface and never went down more than an inch or two and stopped there at the Life Excuse and never pursued our introspections further, to broach, I believe I said, deep in our fundaments the wells of truth like a Texan oil-king... Yes, says Stetson, you and the Delphic Oracle, I believe you said, were of a mind on that one: Know thyself.' And look on the bright side. Man here hanged himself, says Pat. Anyone we know? Freddy Luck, says Pat, a Barnsley man. I knew a Luck before the war, says Slim, but he'd be dead by now. There's a picture, Pat says, but it's a terrible one. At flagbreak, all the lads assembled, and the Commandant, conducting the singing, won  ders what it is they're staring at above his head. Things like that happen all the time in Walkden, Bassett says. Must be the air. Must be the discipline. Paper says he des  paired of ever doing his bit, says Pat, and hanged himself so as not to be a burden. Made over his dole to the War Office. Good job it wasn't one of us, I say, a thing like that before breakfast would've knocked our Captain flat. By flashlight visible where you expected the Union Jack, a man from Barnsley with his trousers down. Take more than that to shake the Walkden man, says Pat. Why, says the Ape, under eitner capacious arm-pit scratching, he should of made it into the nationals, even if the picture's terrible, and I can't make the Echo or the fucking Chron beats me. Shakes his head. The world's injustice. These bloody times, I say, and the cause. If he'd done it for love, or because his insides were bad, or after suffering some final indignity at the hands of that fiend of a Commandant (to pay him back), or by accident when all he wanted was to piss on the company, they'd not have splashed him big, of course they wouldn't, a pag mention in the Walkden Star at the very most and no picture good or bad, but seeing his mo  tive- he left a note did he?- naturally they gave him cover  age. You do it for the War Effort, Ape, and you'll get tret the same. Our Roundhead Carl, with venom: First place he'll \n￼2 not (he daren't) and second if he did it wouldn't be the Fatherland he'd do it for since all he thinks about's him  self. The pole, I say, the man deserves some notice for the trouble he took. Ape, tears in his eyes: How'm I gonna get up there, I'd like to know. I'll bet that Barnsley man had the build for it. I'll give you a bunk up any day of the week, says Stetson. So'11 I, says Carl, I'll fetch the Captain's ladder, just you say the word. But he'll not, he never has, he never will. You seen my arms? Ape cries. Have I ever shown you dis  believing pigs my arms? We have, you have. But show us ag  ain by all means. It may be that in some of us the effect of the sight of them has worn off since yesterday. His many wounds. He bids us feel. The white and jagged wheals \n￼Why, says Ape, under either capacious arm-pit scratching, he should of made it on to the front page/'and into the nat  ionals even if it is only a mention and I've never made it to any front page and never had a mention when I've done it dozens of times and he's done it just the once, is beyond me. Shakes his head. The world's injustice. You never did it- Carl, our houndhead- I wish you had- with venom- 1 wish you would, but you haven't and you won't, worse luck, and if you did you'd still not get a mention, and why should you, who cares? Who cares? Ape, tears are in his eyes. I never had his chances. Look on his card, hobby Horn, next time you're slop ing out the office, i'll bet you a quid he's had a job with poles, or his father had and taught him climbing when he was a kiddie. Nobody taught me climbing poles, no/ owt else either. m my arms?.-he./3rise. Have ever shown ypu disbelievrpff pigs ray arms^XWe have, you/have. But show again by all means, it may/ne that in some of us the ef/ect of the sight of them has^worn off since yesterday. Hi^kmany woundsv/rfe bids us feel./The white and jigged wheals among his hairs. He has even begun, like a man setting his foot on the first rung of Jacob's Ladder, to remind us of the circumstances of each lateral slash, but we stop our ears, we make an uproar, even theGrampus who has forgotten, if he ever knew, his twotimes table and the Creed, can rec  ite the Ape's suicide bids off pat and whenever prompted will do, folding his hands on his stomach and looking at the ceil  ing through his cracked specs. And the stigmata on those hairy arms (on the right also, the left being full) are only the work of razor, knife and broken glass, no you notch on the bedpost, perhaps, your consumption of jars of bleach and fist  fuls of paracetemol? And death by gas? And fatal immersions in lakes, rivers and the North Sea? Where is the tally of these? We were under the bridge once, Fat recalls, by the old lock-up, with a carry-out, and fatty here comes flatting by, shouting for help. Who fished him out? Fishermen, not us. Biggest thing they'd ever landed, but there was nothing in it for them, no body-money, since he wasn't dead. They threw him back? I ran off, sodding wet, and know what 1 did then? Threw yourself under a bus. Amazing you weren't hurt. \n￼What you decide for you, says Norman, peppermint- sucking, is all very well, but it\u2019s when other people are involved it bothers me. Why should they have their fishing interrupted? And what if he had been dead? Would the fiver salvage have made u- for the trouble and having their Sunday spoiled? There's worse, says Albert: that laddie behind the Pit. ilis head on the line. Jesus, finding that. Ape, how many drivers have you given nightmares to by going un er their wheels? They don't know what they're running over, do they? Think it's a human being, says Carl. Well, i'm sorry, says the Ape, I'm very sorry for tnera ail, I'm sure. But it's about time I started looking aiier number One. Nobody else will. Let's face it, Bassett says, what you want when you top yourself is to upset someone. That's my view anyway. I'd like her to find me curled up in the fridge. V/hen she comes home and goes to get her tripe I'd like her to find me in there instead. And I'd like to be there watching her, the silly cow. I'd like to see her face. That's it, I say, but the way things have been fixed you can't be dead and watch your nearest and dearest find the corpse. It can't be done. Sweet forethought at the best, antic  ipation sweetening Bassett's end. His lady in her butter  fly spectacles, plucked eyebrows, sweptback peroxide hair, aghast, remorseful, too late now, see what you made me do, love Sidney. Well, says Norman, that's keeping it in the family at least, and perhaps Mrs Bassett deserves such a shock, it's not for me to say. But I was meaning the General Public. What's it got to do with them? They don't know you from Adam, Ape, they've done you no' harm and I can't see why they should have to clear away your mess. V/alter: there's people paid to do the job. Any man feeling the urge to make away with himself should get where he'll be found by an Official. Well that's all you know about it, Walter # Clever Dick, says Ape, jabbing with a forefinger, the paid ones won't let me anywhere near 'em. They see me coming and they shut the door. Casualty won't touch me with a barge pole, they've said as much, and they told me in the City \n￼4 Mortuary not to come bothering them. There's only the General Public left, xhe coppers won't, the undertakers won't, even the fucking Little Sisters of Mercy won't. D'you know what Mother Bridey said to me last time 1 tried it there, and her a Catholic? She opened the door. Ape was lying on the step, his eyes all gone, clutching his belly. And what did Mother Bridey say? Oh, bloody hell, Ape, not you again. And shut the door. It's alright us saying, he says, not to go throwing himself at total strangers, and keep it in the family at least or address himself to the proper authorities- what family? his only family is his mother's grave in Langley Moor, and not a paid servant within a hundred rniles will give him dying space. I'm barred, he says, no room at the inn. have you tried the tip? Cack asks. 1 should think you'd get in there alright. There's aardiy ever anyone on duty there. Come in the back way where Bougie and me get in with the barrow. 1 could show you places in there where you'd have all the time in the world. Ape: who'd see me on the tip, I'd like to know? Cack: Dougie and me, honey perhaps. Dear God in Heaven, says the Ape, if you think i want Bone peering at me in my dying moments you're quite wrong. I want somebody in white. I want a bit of official human in  terest. /Sammy got it. High up there in the Captain carbide lamp, revealed where we expected the Union/dack. The Captain horror-struck: oh, lower him Stetson, be quic&, be quick. But I suppose that's alrigh^-L the bitter Ape- it's only me the General Public doesn't want to look at. Sammy can top himself where he likes and nobody says a word. Did he ask us if we wanted to look at him with his tongue out before breakfast? No, he didn't. I'm bound to say, I say, that I don't think the wish to create a sen  sation was more than an element, and a subordinate one, in Sammy's decision to h ng himself from our flagpole. He could hardDy have chosen a more prominent position, I grant you, and he must have known, had he thought ahead, that his comrades and the man in whose charge he was would receive a severe'shock at a time of day when they would be least able to withst -.nd it, and yet I'm sure we must / credit him with something more than a childish wish to be ￼\n￼The man from Barnsley got it, high up there in the light of a carbide lamp. But I suppose that's fine- the bitter Ape- it's only me the General Public doesn't want to look at. Buggers like him can top 'emselves wherever they fancy and nobody says a word. Did he ask his mates if they wanted to look at him with his tongue out on an empty stomach? You bet your life he didn't. You forget the cause, I say. For a cause like his a flag  pole's the obvious place and when else should he have chosen if not the early morning discipline of the flag? Set an ex  ample, Slim says. That sort of thing. Nice view he'd have up there, says the Grampus. But for the fact, says Walter, that it was pitch black. Would of then. Had he hung on, I say, he would have heard the first squeakings and creakings of the dawn chorus, always something even in November, he would have seen the dawn... Dawns in November can be of an astonishing redness, like the fires of sexual energy still burning in a man's dis  gusted soul. And then the view, the skyline lovely hills... I'll bet you can see to Ghorley on a clear day, Bassett says. And then the road, the great A6, going north and south, from spike to spike, and all its little stopping places along the way, all the soft touches. But he had a cause and it's not up to me to imagine him being deflected from it by the desperate tweeting of birds and the vistas beyond Walkden cenotaph. \n￼￼7 line of the flag,/andan I suppose the <3apta±-n\\would leave the man ..from Barns\\ley up aloft cebnting Whether to end it all or not? Steytson, 1 reply, you and\\l are chalk and cheese. A liter^ mind is like a nisse\\u2 hut. Nobby, says Ape, you're not a dying man. iJever have been, never will be. Pities me. : Enter Caspar at a lope, his sleeves too short, his eyes too bright. Enter Caspar, the current darling of Apey's armpits. Come here, son, says Ape, extending half a hug, come and sit next to your Uncle Jim. ile sits by me, Ape opposite, and between us on tne tables the daily news, a week ago, slaughter with gusto, cheers and jeers, big letters, exclamation marks and pictures. The boy's a fidget, against my knee I can feel his tremb  ling. Relax, be flat on your feet,not poised thus quiv  ering on your toes as though for flight. And his fing  ers, nail-less, bitten raw, interlocking, unlocking, drumming, clenching. Hands still on a table top, either clasped or lying companionably side by side are a very restful sight, the mind in the head above either xhink- ing quietly to itself or attending without anxiety to some conversation. Caspar's eyes go to and fro, scarea- looking. He wears the sky-blue jacket of a hussar and his jeans are inscribed on either thigh with love-hearts. Bearded? Bum-fluff. Tattoed? Rot the hands, nor so far as it is apparent, lightly hairy, in the manly gap of his collarless shirt, his chest. Be honest- nowhere on his white body does he wear a Mam or a Dad, a Love or a Hate, a dagger, a busty wench, a rauscle-inan, a vampire bat, a spread-eagle, nor even a number, but only an innocent birthmark, somewhat dove-shaped, below his heart, and down his arm, until I scrubbed him with carsolic soap, .there was lettering in biro. His love-bites have all gone, also his bruises and contusions. But not his scars. Kid, says the put-out Ape, these lads wants telling till I'm blue in the face. How many times I done it since you met me? Caspar: Don't ask me. He means it, too. non't put me back in mind of your bloody blood, your belly-clutch  ing, your white eyes (their pinhead pupils), your gurg  lings, your puke, please not again. Half a dozen, he says, \n￼don't ask me. Eyes away, knee against mine going like the shakes. Leave me be. But the Ape, wide-eyed, big-mouthed, expostulates: Half a dozen! My fanny. I done it three times three nights running and you was there. Item: the opening of the veins on the hearth-rug in a little bed  sit in Pity Me. Item: on the same hearth-rug, before the gore had dried, the writhing with asprin. Item: outside, only a stone's throw, the bus. True. In a sense very true. And when you was gone... When he had gone, having had enough, with his bedroll on his back and his dog, a mongrel, trotting to keep up on a long string, and tried the life of bridges, garden- sheds and vacant buildings for a while... the anxiety every evening, the search for where to lay his head, the before-sleep fear of the place, the sleeping cold, the sudden starts in real nightmares, the waking always too early, the day again, cafes, boredom, fear... when he had stuck it about as long as he could he blew in here then, last resort, and knocked at the gate, requesting admission. Can't you read? bawled Little Hitler, no animals in here (except such as are necessary for the maintenance of law and order, Blood namely, and his colleague, Hammer, of a breed intolerant of the survival of others). Can't you read? No he can't, but he gets the message and returns an hour or so later with his wet bedroll and nodoggie on the end of his ten foot piece of string. So there, says Ape, there was fourteen for starters be  fore you left me in it. Then what deplorable nights, no witness, nobody listening, nodody watching, no-one to threat  en with one's imminent decease. Does he shout at himself in the mirror then, I wonder, rant anu rage at himself all night, you heartless fucker, you'll put me in my grave, you wouldn't care if I was dead, go on deny it. I'll do it, then, right here, you see if I don't, you've asked for it, I'll do it right here in front of you... So what? His life. So what? And nothing more valuable to stake. Enough, I say, enough of all this, louve silenced every other contributor, Ape. And yet To Be Or not To Be is a top  ic on which every man might have said hissay. But enough of it. Time of the year no doubt. All Souls, All Saints, ghosts \n￼crowding in, regrets, recriminations, and another winter to get through, to what end? Something a bit more cheerful perhaps. Self-knowledge went well enough, I thought. Fbs- tfaltef) 6ut perhaps we should mavo right away aad- try our thought minds on politics. The Just War's very topical at the moment, perhaps we should try that. There's an hour till lunch and the captain's timetabled it for private re  creation, I believe. We did the Just War last time round, says Pat. I know, I say, but it's a hardy perennial that one, and you-11 not tell me, Pat, we\u2019ve exhaust' d oulr ideas on it, Mebbe not. I put my arm on Caspar's huddled should  ers. There's youngsters here might benefit from the debate. Just War be fucked, says Ape, all red and black, self fucking knowledge my Aunt Fanny's twat, I\u2019mnot done yet, there's things I got to say and it's time l had a hearing. I'm going, says Caspar, I've had enough. Rises. Ape-paw grabs his hand. Sit down. You'll listen or I'll... His wrist. My darling's wrist, never well hidden and now yanked into the gaslight from out of its frayed sleeve, and there indeed is a hurt I care about, worth any twenty of Ape's, across the busy veins and arteries. A pause, a sil  ence. Ape sits, Caspar sits, the wrist overturned on the newspapers, thin, a weak point, too narrow and endangered for the lifeblood to flow there, lies on /its back under all our eyes, white and exposed, and whoever has known a virgin thinks of her now, whoever has ever known anything helpless under his roughness suffers the mixed feelings again and the worst among us in that respect, even they avert their eyes. But Caspar sits staring at his laid-out wrist, and even when the Ape's ba^,ckhand slipsaway, still he displays his wrist and sits therelooking atit. It's the coat, I think, too short in the sleeves, poignant at the best of times, frayed at the cuffs, always rucking up, tight under the arm  pits, gives him a lost look. Caspar stares in pity at his wrist and the unclean, jagged, sf^n-together cut. \n￼10 2 Scene: a public house under the viaduct, The time: late evening. Mrs (Slack: Well I'll be damned, look who's here,:if it isn't our nobbly nuisance from the Institution. To what do we owe the honour etc? Or perhaps you've come to set  tle your debts! (This in tones of blackest sarcasm.; Will you be leaving under your own steam or shall I send Joe for the yellow van? Himself: Now, now, Mrs (Slack, that's no way to greet a friend, i've a very modest request to make over a little glass of something for old times sake. Mrs Clack: You're drunk already or you wouldn't have dar  ed come in here. And any money you've got you can hand over toot-sweet for services rendered in the past. And whatever you're after, the answer's no. Himself: Who's that little feller you've got behind the bar? Mrs (Slack: Mind your own business. He's better to me than you ever were. Himself: I very much doubt that, missus. I can't see a little chap like him keeping his end up for more than thirty seconds. Mrs Clack: I'll thank you to keep a civil tongue. Himself: I'll have a pint of my ordinary, missus, and my request is as follows. Mrs Clack: You'll have a pint of nothing and the answer's no. Besides, I've sold 'em. Himself: You've what? Mrs Clack: Sold 'em. Most of 'em anyway. nimself: My dear Christ, Lilian, you've overreached yourself there. There's a law still in England, I believe, and I'll have it on you before you can say how's your fat  her if you've turned things of mine into cash without my written permission. Mrs Ulack: Don't make me laugh. Drink this and leave my premises. \n￼11 Himself (.civilly): Thank you, Lilian. Your very good health. How much did you get for 'em? Mrs (Jlack: Twelve and six. Himself: Did that include the trousers? Mrs Clack: Think anyone would buy those? I tore them up for rags. What was it you wanted anyway? What do you want to come here again for, working me up and opening old wounds? Himself: My teeth. You didn't sell them, I suppose? I can't see who'd want to buy them if they wouldn't buy my perfectly good trousers. Trousers will fit anybody, but teeth's different. No man can wear another man's teeth, nor no woman either. So what have you done with 'em? Mrs Clack: I never saw any teeth. 1 never knew you had any teeth,iou neverhadanyinwhenyouwerehere.Whatd'you want teeth for now, 1 wonder. If you're after some other poor fool of a lonely woman you needn't think a mouthful of teeth will improve your chances. Himself (very decently): Lilian, what I want with my own teeth is surely my business. I do assure you that I am the possessor of a pair got perfectly legally on the Nash from Haynes and Haynes of Bryony Villas, Monkwearmouth, and if I never had 'em in much during the period of my liaison with you that was because 1 judged, rightly I'm still in  clined to believe, that you preferred my naked gums. Late  ly however, for reasons we needn't go into, 1 have on occasion felt the want of a pair, and I come in here now to ask you, plainly and polite y, if you will be so good as to let me have mine back, xhey were in a cardboard box along with a few little knick-knacks picked up on my trav  els and some private papers. \u2022Mrs Clack (flushing red around the throat and neck and raising her voice so that attention is unnecessarily and unfortunately drawn to this intimate tete-a-tete of the two former cohabitees): Rubbish! (becoming hysterical) Kubbish and filth, that's what was in that box. You and your knick- knacks, you and your private papers. What I saw in that box I never thought I'd live to see. I'm ashamed to think I shared the same public house with you let alone . --- \u20ac v eV \n￼12 Himself: The same bed. Mrs Clack (shrieks;: I'll thank you to keep a civil tongue. Sneak to him, Joe. Am I to stand here being made a mock of in my own bar? Sneak up to him. Himself: Keep your distance, Mouse-Weed. This is between Mrs Clack and me. Hid you or did you not, missus, when you were rooting around in that cardboard box among my private affairs, come across a pair of teeth? Mrs CJack (.araid general hilarity): No, but I came across a pair of something else. You ought to be ashamed of yourself, an old fellow like you, old enough to be somebody's grand  father, you want locking up. Himself: \\Am somebody's grandfather, several people's in fact. Furthermore, I am locked up, most of the time at least. Mrs Clack (shrieking again): You should be locked up all of the time, twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, fifty-two weeks of the year. Himself (with a philosophic sadness): That may come, Lilian, that may come. But now, please, what about my teeth? Did you or did you not spy them in the box? Mrs Clack (dabbing her eyes): No, I did not. Himself: Then may I ask you to be so good as to fetch me the box so that 1 may search in it myself for the missing den  tures . Mrs Clack: I backfired it. Himself (roaring): You did what?! Mrs Clack: I was so upset, seeing them things, and your .dirty scribblings, I backfired the lot, crying my eyes out. Himself (aggrievealy): Lilian, my teeth were in that box, never mind the other things which, whatever you might have thought of them, were of considerable sentimental value to me. I don't know what to say to you, Lilian. You, of all pe >ple_jT wouldn't have expected it of you. There's a seamy side to every man's character- that's how we're made- but under your good influence, Lilian, who knows? in time I might \n￼13 have struggled free of it and grown more worthy of the trust you was pleased to put in me. Now, however, expelled, living in the company of the depraved, I\u2019ve little or no chance of mending my v/ays before the Reaper takes me like a thief in the night on the end of his scythe. There ensues a pause, in which Mrs Clack silently replenishes Mr Horn's empty glass and the eaves  dropping clientele, rough men for the most part brutalized in infancy by a mother's coldness or a father's violence^, draw the soiled sleeves of their tattered coats across their watering eyes. Mrs b'lack(touching Mr Horn's hand): I didn't backfire it, Hobby, it's in the bin. We had no fire that day. I only said so to upset you. I was that worked up, I would have burned it if we'd had a fire but we had no fire that day, we were expecting the chimney sweep, so I threw them in the bin. Himself: And what day was that, missus, may I ask? Mrs Clack: Last Monday. Himself: And what day's bin-day in these parts? Mrs Clack: iou ought to know. Himself: Remind me, Lilian. ht\\. Ukia XG*&ian: Monday. Himself: And where are we now? Mrs Clack: Sunday. t Himself: And had they already been, the bin-men, when you threw my cardboard box in the bin? Mrs Clack: Aye, just. Himself: So there's six days rubbish on top of it. Mrs Clack: Yes, I'm afraid there will be, Hobby.But lucky it's there still and not took away to the tip. Himself: And what bin is it in? Mrs Clack: I can't remember, ilow do you expect me to remem  ber that? I was too wrought up to know what I was doing. Per  haps I did backfire it. Serve you right if 1 did. Perhaps we did have a fire that day after all. But Joe'll help you look \n￼14 through the bins, won't you Joe, there's only three of 'em, it'll not take you long. And by the time you've done with that I'll have this place closed and then mebbe you'll stay for some cocoa with Joe and me, he'll be welcome, won't he Joe? Joe: Yes, missus. The two men, starkly contrasting in deportment, exit through the widow's private door into the yard. As the door opens there is heard the noise of an express train hurtling over the viaduct high above them. The glasses behind the bar tremble musically. Mrs Clack: Last orders gentlemen, please. In a mood of mildest conviviality customers order their last drinks and many who have never been smiled upon before are smiled upon now by the widow Lilian Clack who, many affirm, has never looked more blooming. However, just as the towels go up, an alarming hubbub is heard in the yord, a noise as of tom-cats fighting and a breaking of glass, rhe Marquis is sent to investigate but as he opens the widow's private door enter Himself, fishbones in his grey curls. He is dis  gustingly smeared with rotten fruit and ashes, under his left arm he holds a soiled and battered cardboard box and aloft, triumphantly, in his right hand, his dentures which he snaps aggressively at the company, chortling the while in a satanic glee. Mrs Clack: What the-! \u2022Himself: Halha! ha! ha! ha! ha! Through the open door are heard groans, a slow goods train clanks through the sky. Himself, his fles undone, dances from behind the bar and twirls absurdly before the astonished clientele, snapping the teeth and chanting: \u2018\u2019Clack, Clack, the Widow Clack, I've had her from the front and I've had her from the back!* \n￼15 Most recoil in disgust, a few, the Marquis foremost among them, seek to apprehend and calm him, but he eludes them, dancing from one foot to the other and clacking the dentures in their faces.
