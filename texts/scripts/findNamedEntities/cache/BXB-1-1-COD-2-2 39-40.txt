Still, she turned And lifted her face to the rim of beech-light And the lea^sieved sky. And again her name Came down the slopes to her, tugging like grief With little cries. So she was drawn. The blue ground Let go of her in a white furrow and where She had entered at the horseshoe\u2019s opening Now she began in earnest her long haul Against the streams, ascending slowly by Degrees of blue under the cavernous light, A floppy corpse of flowers on her left arm With midnight hair, with blue dark thoughts, with white Uprooted feet. Standing in the shallows, Black to the waist, cradling the lolling doll, She had no sight nor sound of her lost name. Her bluebell lips, smiling at nobody, Clouded the cold air with a breath of roots. \n￼Autumn Lady\u2019s Tresses In late summer the Lady\u2019s Tresses Spiral to light leafless and stand Almost as bare rods. But flowers Proceed upwards by an upbraiding or as When the wind frays The scything edge of a wave. Thyrsus, Snake of ivy. Flowers Without energy of colour, at the least remove From the stem\u2019s green. Torch-flower, Faintlight, but prized by finders As much as wentletraps The white unicorn The winding stairway shell. Autumn Crocuses The naked boys, entering the light, Their root-whiteness suffuses upwards with a colour. Then, So long as they hold the sun\u2019s eye, Light through and through and barely tethered, They stand hovering. They die When they empty of sun, sleeves Of their life lie on the soil crumpling. 40 / ","docTitle":"","docDate":"2014-07-01 09:47:41.845"},"meta":{"contentType":"text/raw","emVer":"7.1.1103.5","langIdVer":"DefaultLangId","processingVer":"CalaisJob01","submissionDate":"2014-07-01 09:47:41.424","submitterCode":"57b17a53-6e34-87b0-20ff-a419896f49c9","signature":"digestalg-1|JXi14mfLI735oLqNFJzxfK/KZJg=|iPG62QDMl1/B1Ma0mCdv8HsrGAFdDXFSKX3rcZ4hXOla0655execaA==","language":"English"}},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/244e8269-f4c4-3748-83c1-a324b36eb5c6/lid/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http://d.opencalais.com/lid/DefaultLangId/English"},"http://d.opencalais.com/pershash-1/cf1e1a55-ad00-34b7-ad70-a76e742660b1":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"Person","name":"Autumn Lady","persontype":"N/A","nationality":"N/A","commonname":"Autumn Lady","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/Person","instances":[{"detection":"[Clouded the cold air with a breath of roots. \n￼]Autumn Lady[\u2019s Tresses In late summer the Lady\u2019s Tresses]","prefix":"Clouded the cold air with a breath of roots. \n￼","exact":"Autumn Lady","suffix":"\u2019s Tresses In late summer the Lady\u2019s Tresses","offset":911,"length":11}],"relevance":0.298},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/05bb2646-0ab8-3a48-b4eb-d29cfd33ce39":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"IndustryTerm","name":"energy","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/IndustryTerm","instances":[{"detection":"[a wave.
