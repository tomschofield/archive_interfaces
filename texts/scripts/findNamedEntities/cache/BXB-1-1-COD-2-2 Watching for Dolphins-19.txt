So after his swim Leander\u2019s fingers appeared on Hero\u2019s sill And he hauled himself inside, naked and salt And grinning.

Dining together at a round table, who Sat between whom that night one could not say. Candaules and the Queen when they withdrew Equally trailed their glances. Rhodope, Docile to his wishes, let the candles burn And faced him nude. But he was looking past her, Dry in the mouth, and whispered would she turn? Font of his happiness without demur This too she did, smiling, almost as when She first stood seen by one alone of men. 12 \\ \n￼Minos, Daedalos and Pasiphae Minos himself, like any supplicant, Came clumsily asking how it might be done. Daedalos smiled: nothing the heart might want Surprised him, who had Ikaros for a son. None knew, so perfect was the counterfeit, None among those who ran to take the bull, Dropping bewildered from coition, in a net; Only the King, who watched. The woman, full, Penned what she bore in the Labyrinth to die. It grew. They heard it roaring for the light of day, They heard it blunder through the passages and try - Sobbing with a human hope\u2014another way. They wished a slayer would come. Their normal child Looked monstrous to the Queen.

The eternal Quinn Walks the aisle among them back and forth with gin And little chocolates from Padua. Some roar The old songs and some in accompaniment snore. Others have died. Their purpose in these parts Is to inspect the farms. Tables and charts Such as fix Easter fix their itinerary Yet perhaps none, save Topham driving, of all their company Knows, having arrived, whether this year Wiltshire Or Westmorland receives them. Still, they enquire In Latin after the yields of fields and the condition of fences, Of hinds and swine, the increase, or whether pestilences And civil strife have taken many off And what the knacker gave. Ale and snuff Outside the byre go round. They slap a cow, A wife, and from the fob, with a free hand, throw Pecks of advice, till Topham\u2019s ancient horn Calls them away. Departing they- have drawn On summer evenings white inmates to The workhouse bars in glee, but who Has seen, uncrazed, unblinded, on Gibbet Hill The singers tumble from their car pell-mell Snorting to piss? Topham and Quinn decide Among the rest who sleep and who have died And sit the latter grinning in a row Against a gate, by seniorityj then stow The quick, relieved, with trailing cummerbunds And flapping spats, back in. Polite Quinn stands Smiling upon them in a queer blue light / Such as flickers over marshes when the farts ignite. \n￼*1 Sad Ends Be assured: we shall not linger for ever thus. Conclusive death will come to all of us. Many of our kind make sad ends, Macabre, pathetic, even among friends Eternally risible. Poor Tusker, full, Dropped from the windy tiles and broke his skull As we climbed to Common Room; our loving cup, The horn of an auroch, carelessly raised up Stabbed harmless Lamb; and Molineux, Surprised by his servant and modestly'clapping to Burke\u2019s Cornucopia Pornographic/ Died with a sudden shout. Many are And various the ways to Hades. At Michaelmas I woke to find myself in utter darkness In our library\u2019s fundament. Nobody came. Who comes Indeed but once in a blue moon after the tomes That interest me? Alone injthe labyrinth of learning, Cold and alone in the very sump of it and hearing Worms gnawing my knowledge, on all fours Crawling hither and thither in the dust for hours Feeling for exit, I thought of someone\u2019s Pleasure on finding me as a heap of bones Centuries hence, some bold follower After me in the mines of erudition or Some paid inspector of our cloacal tracts. O Crusius, saint of scholars, to whom such facts As the angle of declension of the left testicle In ancient statuary were dear, if possible Let me get quicker below than via starvation And, if it may be, let my passing on Not be too foolish or indecent. May I, Asleep, be smitten by something heavy, Say Crowe on Haggai or Farthing on God\u2019s love, Falling mercifully from a shelf above. Let me not, ending, cause merely one more snort Of merriment among the empurpled over their port.
