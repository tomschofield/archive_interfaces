Nice birds though, ya done alright there, mate But watcha talking like that for? Oh, they don't speak English, don't they? Well, whyya bowering with them Froggie slags then? Talking never did any good anyway - give us 'emover 'ere,they can talk to our meat, that's Esperanto, innit? Watcha sayin to em? Oi, cunt, watcha sayin to em? Talkin bahrt us, are ya?

No, these were just nasty, mean-spirited scum, celebrating the values of the last thirteen years - the values of crass ignorance seifishne violence and of course 'pride in being British' Was it for this, the 1944 Education Act? - v \n￼people are murdered every day, of course - in this nasty, brutish zit of a country, often for even more unbelievably banal reasons - so why this poem? Simply that I remember avisittoapub my own bilingual conversation (it's a skill, you know, you learn it, like medicine or carpentry a skill that most Europeans take for granted) and the broken beer glass and the contorted face of the thug when I replied to Ms insult in Ms own tongue - For me it ended differently but when I saw that story in the paper a shiver ran down my spine I remembered that evening in the pub and the impotent anger swelled uncontrollably in my guts....

Fifty years ago, in a moment of ill-informed spitefulness, the Laureate and knighthood-destined John Betjeman cast a grievous poetic slur on an innocent Berkshire town.
