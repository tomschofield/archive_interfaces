We were a ring: the clock ticked round us For that time and the wind was deflected. The clock pecks everything to the bone. The wind enters through the broken eyes O f houses and through their wide mouths And scatters the ashes from the hearth. Sleep. Do not let go my hand. \n￼Birdsong Most are sleeping, some Have waited hopelessly for mercy, Others even by this will not be stayed.

Locus Amoenus One read of the place where the covert mound rose Flanked by slopes, and clear water Issued below for thirst and the excited mind And the senses equally were delighted. One read of that pleasant place in the writers of pastoral And imagined its charms scattered over an earth Less than so beautiful, and thinking never to come there Did: and found it surpassed their praises. Musee du Louvre These courtiers in a wood have come upon her Rising before them moonlike in a clearing. She strikes their eyes, their hands are all upraised At the light she sheds upon them from her scallop. Far inland henceforth, deep in the heart\u2019s covert, Closing their eyes they will always hear the sea. has X \n￼Musee Rodin They saw the figures of Fugitive Love and supposed them Wrought to the condition of subtility By one another\u2019s hands: she streams away And the soul may be seen, playing upon her limbs. The hotel bed was bordered with a mirror Where they reviewed those figures, curious What novel disposition of themselves Would lend their evanescence form. Chartres and Avignon One could not look through it nor did the light From outside enter as light of day But passed inward in the form of a persuasion That love hungers and will be filled by No dexterity. That was the window of Mary, O f post coitum tristis. Waking In Avignon he saw her beside him sleeping with The sheet thrown off, arms and throat Already burned from travelling. The dirty pane Showed a blueness under which the town With sprinkled gutters foretasted the dust And thin shade under walls at noon. Gothic or Classical / Reading that in the depiction of the female body North and south of the Alps there were two traditions By stages night after night in disreputable hotels North and south of the Alps he examined whether She approached more nearly the Gothic or the Classical Bearing in mind from Paris a certain Venus As far as Florence where a lascivious Eve Displayed her teeth-marks in the bitten apple. David Constantine \n￼/ \u2018The mind then\u2019 The mind then seems to become the burning point Of the other senses, when by day Arches are seen and one\u2019s delight converges At their tips and down the aisles, and when In darkness are corresponded all parts having stiffness Actual or potential, likewise All declivities and entrances and more are devised And the mind then is the glass, burning. Rodin rkT Upon his dictum \u2018Dessiner c\u2019-est connaatre\u2019 Gossip put a lewd connotation Saying that master of the essence and forms of women Entered the place his pencil had depicted. Oh do not leave it to gossip lewdly to imply Our certainty that through the foolish penis Exact and loving knowledge comes. To that point The cognisance of all the senses runs.
