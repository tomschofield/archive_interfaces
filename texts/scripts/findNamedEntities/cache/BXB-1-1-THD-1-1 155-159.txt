The scene is the Convent ofMurano, Venice. 1 Do my eyes\u2019 gazing, Murano master, Jesus, And my meek up-offered breasts make you too lovesick, Dim, high on Cross? I\u2019ll swear your prick rose! I, Maria Maddalena, loveliest of petitioning sisters. O let night come, the pictures, the entwining Poses, let my breasts swing from nun\u2019s blacks free! 2 Time drags. This wearisome chanting!...My ecstatic sisters Assault you with aves. Giacomo never guessed, entwining His lips with ours. I\u2019ll tell him tonight, each rose Is a prick, is a round window, gives a free View of us; see how he takes it. Jesus, The very thought makes me stretch lovesick! 3 All night, spying! My flesh sweats like a rose. Seraphic, Caterina kneels amidst the sisters, Her mouth stuffed full with that word Jesus. Dear, green child! Though, God be thanked, no more lovesick Of Giacomo: last night\u2019s trio made her mind free. 4 Shy to begin - albums, frescos worried her - lovesick Novice; till \u2018Which of our breasts please you?\u2019 I ask him, and free Mine; Caterina follows; soon, with blushes, entwining Happily.

Tomorrow, Giacomo must watch, must crouch lovesick, Unseen, beholding our rearranged, entwining Trinity. And last, breathless brothers and sisters, Do you watch our quartet of joys, I pray you, Jesus! 6 Caterina smiles secretly...Would my lips were entwining Hers under your horned cuckoldry, Jesus! One day you will shut our soulful eyes, sisters. Dust will close up the vulva of each rose. Giacomo will forget me. Empty will be the lovesick Casino. Our skulls will lie alone and free. 7 Let nights pass stormy as a crimson rose! God rot that we should rot here with these sisters! Send my beauty from God\u2019s Leads go free! / 157 e \n￼Thomas 155-192 11/11/92 9:15 am Page Christ on Palomar I have come out of the cave, gulped the thin air, entered the white dome which is more silent, more laden with awe than the great temple of the prophets. My brain reels under spectrographs and maps of galactic clusters. I was a simple carpenter. Pulsars, quasars and neutron stars. All such is beyond me. I thought only of love, creating them. I no longer pretend to understand my progeny, why this particular, chance design. Plough, neversetting as the cells of generation, why did you sow so prodigally, demoniacally? 158 \n￼Thomas 155-192 11/11/92 9:15 am Page Andromeda\u2019s wheel, you are bland as a pharisee, luminous, doublemeaninged, as one of my parables. I know that, if the faintest star fell or were added, the whole would collapse like a card-house, but I no longer remember why. I bear a heavier cross now, the culpability, the burden of it all. I am blinded by the weight of stars. They stream towards me across fields of space-time, poor but confident: too many prodigal sons. 159 ","docTitle":"","docDate":"1992-11-11"},"meta":{"contentType":"text/raw","emVer":"7.1.1103.5","langIdVer":"DefaultLangId","processingVer":"CalaisJob01","submissionDate":"2014-07-01 09:57:00.801","submitterCode":"57b17a53-6e34-87b0-20ff-a419896f49c9","signature":"digestalg-1|DwA9+HHAZyXI6u/3wpjwg53Rewg=|bJ01Y4gGDMyOMuXYoIi4YYc3l9+DnrQWsWvAQjA9BHDiOfzs04YMLw==","language":"English"}},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/917fc1e9-57dc-3840-a4be-c80c7814f5c9/lid/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http://d.opencalais.com/lid/DefaultLangId/English"},"http://d.opencalais.com/pershash-1/b252518e-0968-3b44-b840-82edd8821f1b":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"Person","name":"Caterina","persontype":"N/A","nationality":"N/A","commonname":"Caterina","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/Person","instances":[{"detection":"[encounters with two nuns, Maria Maddalena and ]Caterina[, at the private casino ofAbbe de Bernis.
