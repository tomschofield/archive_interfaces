G o on, forget her.\u2019 She says we are inventing new ways of shipping men and women and all her art is aiming for a raft that swimmers reach and share. She says this that it may be so. You did not worry as you lay beached together through a starless night; an obscured moon still pulls the tides of billow-talk and pillow-friends. These words come from Proverbs, Tess, and the Koran; dogs bark above our heads and yet the caravan moves on. 26 \n￼Love-Torn Squaddie in Rannoch Torment Being, show me your ground. Only the moor and a keep o f castellated cloud and the wind moving on as she did, snagged enough to make roots whine like children left behind. He waits for his heart to stop but it won\u2019t. That\u2019s all the ground there is, soldier, it\u2019s all ground, even the airy-fairy cloud-castle on the hill, even the shrilling in your chest. Being torn between moving on and being left behind, he wavers shredded among heather. \n￼The House-Builder Variations A workshop - principal materials: saw. drill, rule, nails, a plain deal table Unemployed? Growing rusty? You want a house that is unique - home in on this! 1lere\u2019s your drill, the hammer-action for concrete, this is your saw, your rule, your plain deal table. These are the trees. The compassionate State awards you with a gross of nails. Such are your true materials. Confused? You want to shelve it for today? Believe me, if you pass on children you must make something o f your own, or live aloner than alone. A better deal! Unemployed, not unique, this was his drill: plane it true, hammer the State, nail it to a tree. But the old saws were rusty, the rule was bent, he made nothing at the table. (He could have said it in spades, but spades are disallowed materials - you think association\u2019s free?) What frame could house such passion? It must be concrete, too gross to shelve. Confused, alone, he passes on today. Concrete poems? A house of cards, shuffle them as you will! Deal anyway. What was it she saw that made the trees seem jungular today? (Nothing\u2019s disallowed, but old drills are bent as is the State and its materials.) As a rule, truth\u2019s a shelf that takes unique confusion to nail it to the wall. Unemployment takes a hammering today as she sits making passionate children in her swaying home high in the trees. 56 \n￼Here\u2019s what I saw when I took that hammering: alone is gross. Let us live in free association, where is not material. Plain dealing! Believe me (though I am swaying), a bent rule is unique. We shall be shelf-employed! Today is concrete passion. Nail down this truth: I love you though the drill be rusty and the state confused. \n￼Copyright (C) Andrew Greig 1990 ISBN: 1 85224 102 0 First published 1990 by Bloodaxe Books Ltd, P.O.

We\u2019ve come to be both audience and show. Mai flicked his lighter, an avalanche roared - we have come to assert everything fits and we believe the true scale of things is the entire mountain hung mirrored in our shades. # All day snow sank in the billy, was boiled, drunk, peed, replenished as we passed the mountain through us. The chat was home and axes, hopes, seracs. The voices tire, yellow lights hiss as night comes on to very few witnesses but enough. Lnblinking stars and lightning \u2014 the theatre\u2019s hushed. From the heights we propose to the depths we\u2019ve left our shadows gesture and stretch. 10 \n￼Interlude on Mustagh Tower In these high places we are melting out of all that made us rigid; our ice-screws hang loose on the fixed ropes to the Col. Monday in the Himalaya, the clouds are down, our objective is somewhere, but obscure - let it soar without us for a day! We lounge in thermals on the glacier, brewing and shooting the breeze, that improbable project of conversation among the living. Laughter rings across the ice. Why not? None of us will die today - that\u2019s immortality' you can draw on in a cigarette, harsh and sweet, the way we like it. Steam rises from the billy, Sandy pours. It is true high, worked for, that we pass hand to hand between us with our brews. Men on ice, going nowhere and laughing at everything we cannot see but know is there - among the cloud, on the Col, a hand of some sort is tightening our screws. \n￼Sandy, Topping Out on Mustagh So began to lead the last of the Tower Quite hard more bold than difficult tough ice loose snow but soon brain began to play the game My points investigated stabbed good placements to be had among loose choss Crucified by altitude I bridged a steepish rockwall Good value that I remember everything like ice-slivers in my windsuit\u2019s creases Camp 4 a thousand feet beneath mv heels climbing into my shadow the sun flashed off my axe Jon he was somewhere giving good rope and no advice the ideal second but me I was gone Nice work when you can get it the hardest the best hours passed till I wanted a think and a rest so thumped in an ice-screw and hung out awhile \u2014 Like I cannot spell, speak porter-talk but who does not who\u2019s lived like me with oil roughnecks and a French girl? One look in her eyes, I know. One straight hit, I find good ice. Climbing's not so much, my life's more in the way I eat myfood, the man I rise above, the roads I drive tofriends, these suit - Re-engaged myself and winkled on with patient pickers unlocked the crux set my axes well and at full stretch pulled over the top and saw into China 12 \n￼HEAD WAS MUTE □ felt ok^felt well (a cheval across the summit) K2 in the distance looking good (suspicion of moisture behind my shades) Made a belay and took in the ropes as Jon came up. So how\u2019s it going? Oh, wasted, youth... \u2018From Base Camp to the stream there is a path now and the grass is yellow at the centre o f the path. \u2019 t 13 \n￼Entering Askole (for Malcolm Duff) On the eighth evening we entered Askole. How can I tell you? We had seen no habitation in two months. Brown dogs twitched in the shade, a chicken screamed; we smelled dung, dall, smoke, lentils; many voices, the bronze fields shone. Lean as schoolmasters, tall wheat rapped our knuckles as we limped into the square. Say there are miracles between where babies twitch and sleep and old folk sleep and totter. Water-mills spun, yaks plonked circles round the threshing floor. Evening prayers, a sleeping miller, tawny goats stole husks of wheat. Goitres hung like apples on the children\u2019s necks. The Hadji lightly touched our backs, Summit good... We had been above ourselves, hooked to pure worlds of black & white & blue, the narrow world of sleeping bags. In Askole we smoked and talked till dawn then rose and crossed the river, paid the porters, jeep did the rest. We broke down, sang \u2018It will come hard to sleep on beds as soft and wide as ours.\u2019 J/ 14 \n￼The Winter Climbing (forM arj) It is late January and at last the snow. I lie back dreaming about Glencoe as fluent, hungry, dressed in red, you climb up and over me. That passion claimed the darkest, useless months for risk and play. You rise up on me, I rise through you... The shadowed face of Aonach Dubh where M ai first took me climbing and as we clanked exhausted, happy, downwards through the dark, I asked \u2018What route was that?\u2019 \u2018Call it what you want - it\u2019s new.\u2019 You reach the top and exit out; from way above, your cry comes down. The rope pulls tight. What shall we call this new thing we\u2019re about? These days we live in taking care and chances. Why name it? My heart is in my mouth as I shout Climbing... t 15 \n￼A Reader\u2019s Note b c B Mazed Call him anything, call him Jim . At any road a Scottish male of a certain age stands hopeful, hesitating, lost. He scuffs the dust, unable to go on or back. I want to see him on the rack. Compressed or stretched, the heresies will show. And mock him carefully, you who go to govern or deplore, judging or not judging, in all events undone. The riders of our times left notes behind of intrigues high and low; one sings of love, another of the shredding of a document... He scans these tales of power - screwed up, corrupt, infolded, though I would not have it so. It was the things the women said fair mazed our Jim; contrary shocks crazed him as they do with rats. First they taught him sensitivity, to chop onions very fine and cry, prioritise the lady of his life. He got the knack. Applause! Then she whose absence still defines these screwey situations, left to flame it with his pal Bill. Liveforfriends, get in touch with your distress. But soon enough his distresses got in touch with him - a right good kicking filled him in. His bruises were stupendous; in diverse beds he was rewarded, sundry titbits showered on him. Then Jenny came from Aberdeen to say Enough. Binge-time is over, the cheese is moved. Worh, discipline, avoiding dread diseases will be the key-notes ofthe 90s. Without political understanding there is only pain - go sniffit out. Certitude o f the educators, high ground of the women, tests of the high heid vins! Quivering, ardent - a rapier, a whippet, as easily broken - she raps him on the chest: Now you mustforgetyourfeelings. Sod this for a game of mazes. He resigns. On his back for days, pinky feet in the air. What you doing, Jim? Minding the ceiling, and its bars... 22 / IW X VTAV.VC.S © \n￼Shetland He sailed for Shedand, very near the edge, to bog & cliff & a celibate friend. She did her helpless best by him. He climbed all day and failed to fall. Light-hoarding stars above her bed, a full moon on the wall - he wanted to be dead, and badly. A mortal sin, she said, I tried it. Well, she was Catholic but that stuck. No way out but up. At the cruxy he clutched into the chimney\u2019s heart and heaved... He taped his knuckles, she poured the wine. Only reflected light this tenderness, but still that night they lay like pardoned thieves - baffled, eased, beside her moon, beneath her paper stars. 24 \n￼About Tess She cocks her head, considers another country, you. Smoke infiltrates your throat. The rasp that says you\u2019re not dead yet is the trigger of seductions. \u2018And do you evervfishe enquires, \u2018act on your irresolution?\u2019 T h e bar\u2019s de-stabilised, you colonize each other as folkies sing of Nicaragua. \u2018All right,\u2019 one hand on hers, the other grips your car keys, \u2018Why not?\u2019 There are reasons, but they melt like wax. Relax. Tonight you cross the border. You cast huge shadows as you get into the car. /' A \\ V ^ t 25 \n￼lL In the Morning The white cat at the window knows being composed around itself. Two mechanics lean over my car; today\u2019s composed around what goes and what does not \u2014New points, son, condenser'sgone. The philosophical one borrows a smoke, pokes the engine, spak^s ofMaya, the VeilofIllusion. Stuff and nonsense! This no-start\u2019s stuff enough - No problem, a tenner - that\u2019s the nonsense. Make it five? Money\u2019s real too, there should be more poems about money. Six and it\u2019s done. This is not counterfeit. You\u2019re on. In the Afternoon So get cracking, hand me back my life-enhancing cigarette! That Veil: rend it as you will, nothing\u2019s hung behind. Is she not beautiful, tranced in the doorway? In her breathed warm breath there is no other. O f course I\u2019m scared - to love and risk it while today goes up in smoke! Go, roll one of your own. My car goes, our hearts ease off the brakes - We\u2019re jn a spin somewhere the white cat at the window knows. Annie 32 \n￼Gulf Nothing is missing, said she on Cairn Gorm, world turns and we turn with it, not losing touch. I'll always loveyou and but In the Gulf a frigate lowered its defensive screen for a chat \u2014men were blown away. Sorrypal, I didnVmean... The plane flew back to base in some confusion. Soon she did too. M en yearn, metal yawns, verses implode memory and daily news. Between I & I the holy wars elide; between us rose words - lovely, direct, misguided, like love, an Exocet. \n￼Annie, in November A last pibroch in South Qiteettsferry Enough fourteen-bar compressed & gurgling pibrochs for you, Annie, whoever you were (I mythed you). There are affairs more pressing than love, say they who have it. So look around. The satellite disc shines on the new deli; library hours are cut; my neighbour\u2019s roof leaks into mine (would we were separate, or one)... The Chancellor parks his belly on TV, proclaims Auld Scotia is a bag of wind squeezed in History\u2019s oxter. Behind my town the fields are burning, it is time to leave. Rush hour. The trucks point North and whine the wild notes, the low sun splits the Road Bridge like a reed. \n￼Ruth Says This is not passion, but with pleasure I see you note how well I am undressed in black. Clear sight shows our age, lines curved around the mouth like brackets, as though we smile as an aside (as though desire were a little joke we like to tell from time to time). We are not in love, we are not drowning in needy dreams, so we may lay down our weary arms, unconfused by fate and feeling; I am composed as we surrender, eyes wide open even as they close. \n￼Covert Action Beneath the coverlet the President\u2019s mind is acting up; he dreams he is the President, which means he is responsible. For what? The lot of The Free World & dirty doings without number such as haunted the Macbeths. Pick one: Jungle, clearing, hut. D oor\u2019s kicked down/ bullets fan the air; the wife, the son^, the daughter, redden and fold. Rocks drop from their hands. Yup, guerillas! The Peace Force torch the lot, exit right up the sleeve of the star-spangled night... To pay for this he must raise taxes! He sweats, fumbles for light. Dreamed I wus the President, he tells his wife. You are, dear, you are. She sleeps and sees the Nobel Prize for Peace crowning hubby\u2019s noble head. His pyjamas cling, the nightlight flickers, Old Glory stirs upon the wall. Aw', who among us lacks his Banquo? Pay the First Murderer, let the drunken Security weep, for all the screw-ups check in here. Who screams? Who knocks? Mr President - it would make one mad, if not already \n￼Young American I sleep, I don\u2019t, she listed all the heart-crimes I\u2019ve committed. Cover-ups, plots, double-cross, betrayal in diverse jungles \u2014truths most economical swooped from her throat. W orse, wheeling in her nightdress she released her lovers\u2019 names. Her words cling, burn like our modern Nessus shirtf, napalm. Worst, when I wake there is no angry young American at my side. Men cry but are not cooled, just terrified; the imperial wings still burst above my head, within. \n￼Fishing He may love her when he does not say \u2018I love you\u2019 then hang on her reply. Who does not go fishing with such lines? Across the livingroom her wrist flicks, the hook digs in. In the kitchen he is floundering - who knows when to cut the line? He twists the tap and sees down to the bottom. He could leave coffee where she sits, smile, say nothing, drift into the garden... She crochets steadily, taking him in. 40 \"1 <1 \n￼D, in a Checked Shirt I\u2019ve chopped all day and stacked my pile. Father taught me no one else was good enough - little wonder I must work till I bleed, bop till I drop at local dances. I can split a match with a woodsman\u2019s axe and have no lasting lovers. The way I roll my sleeves, that final tuck\u2019s my father; the shirt is yours as I am mine - I\u2019ve taken every risk but that. Father told me: give up nothing. So I don\u2019t when I undress; you saw my eyes when you asked me to unbutton more. No can do. Your shirt is wringing but I like sweating me as you did. My body\u2019s perfect, my skin|| tight as a drum, nothing rattles me - The perfect barbarian with a PhDj aches and lies down again, alone. How that single candle spits and yearns! Why should you call? The axe is bedded in the log. I have a winter\u2019s burning. \n￼The Maid & I \u2018At this stage, I work must closely with theMaid' New York composer -j\\|rO g c b T C S It\u2019s nothing personal when she slips in at half-dawn, half-dusk, any drifting time of day, to make mere solitude complete. That\u2019s how come we get on so well, so long. You smile, you picture black seamed stockings, white muslin crown on hair that\u2019s poised to be let down? No, she is not Naughty Lola - no/Mrs Mopp! With us it is importunate to talk or stare; touch is right out. This fortunate proximity is all we share. She has arrived. You are in the backroom, by the Steinway, fiddling with the Blues. You hear her humming as she moves among the papers and abandoned meals, clearing up the ashtrays, scripts and coffee cups, the litter of aloneness. Redeeming fingers touch your old scores lightly, as if it were yourself she dusts and settles on the shelf. Praise the maid who sets out flowers and white clouds where you might see them and be glad! The ha^ie would be total were it not for her. Now she is singing an old refrain you can\u2019t quite...The sky is pale, washed clean by rain, hung up against the evening. As you attend, a melody floats through apartment walls so intimately it is as though you quote yourself - debris is sorted, order is invented or restored. Now she is done. You will work on alone but that\u2019s all right. Grace must have its means. She flicks the light on as she leaves. \n￼Wallace Stevens in East Fife If it is anywhere, it must be everywhere - the mind stumbles after the divine finding nowhere to halt or grip. It must be the bush and the wind that wrassles it, the invisible shook by the visible, the howl shaken from wind by telephone lines. It must be speech on the phone and the silence that resumes and speech resuming that conversation between speech and silence which so shook Sam B., discerning howl in music, music in the throat of howl. It must be anytime and at all times, in the living man and the dead, in the greatcoat stumbling on the coast, in the grey coast stumbling through the head. \n￼A North Sea Twist-ofT I got oiled on my last night on-shore, recalling lovers thrown over shoulders like peel so we could read the initial of the one we shoulda married or eaten whole... These drastic shifts caught up wi me; if I\u2019d worked today I woulda crushed my hands. So I\u2019ve arranged things so I can\u2019t, wrote off fifty grand\u2019s machinery. It has long been my ambition to make a major blunder; now I\u2019ve succeeded, for today at least. The shaft is plugged, it\u2019ll take days more to extract the cock-up from the core. # Too much was going down. We grouped like para-medics round a cardiac arrest to bolt another section to our mile-long probe. I did it then. Som e suspect, nane saw t+wt flick of the wrist. We swarmed in oilskins around catastrophe, pumped down urgent cooling mud, muttered soothing angry words, Come on beauty, donVbreakoffnow...Too late. The twist-off was complete. We shrugged, separated, hurt by our incompetence, glad of the break. \n￼I need the money, I need the work, I need the green grease on my palms. These are the first and last, the fast realities that let us roar to vanishing-point on our machines. But there are times I canna watch the whining, blurry revolutions screw the planet and ourselves as we shudder into pay-dirt. Yet I\u2019m convinced I need the money, so I do. * We can\u2019t work till the technicians come. Could stay on, doing nothing on half-pay, skimming girlie m ags... I\u2019ll pass, chopper out and lie for days somewhere, a long-abandoned spanner in the grass, rusting, unadjustable. She phone7frae Ullapool last night, thick with the cold, or maybe she wis gre^tin, I never will dare ask. These needs that grow... It was fun once, now I\u2019ve packed my gear - let\u2019s go. Boom-time\u2019s over and we aa got shafted. \n￼Bagatelle Dreams A Canadian rock star has 'a had case offlu \u2019 TRACK A My doctor said I have nervous exhaustion. This must be why I\u2019m water-skiing on my back along a blue canal. The wake fans out. I cannot see what\u2019s coming but there is no fear, all is blue rush and surrender. Bless the doctors for this ride of unexamined joy! My nerves are young in summer; above, the boat\u2019s exhaust makes temporary clouds... TRACK B 1 need a holiday, this m ust be why I\u2019m side-stepping the concrete bagatelle of Yonge Street\u2019s high arcade. Muggers? No fear! I\u2019m wearing elbow-length gauntlets, my blue plexi-glass diver\u2019s helmet - I out-weird everyone here. When the steel ball thunders, I wrap around it, waving goodbye. I am being rolled head-first towards m ore... FIRST MIX The doctor said I need a nervous holiday. This must be why I\u2019m back skiing high on a street canal, young fans in my wake. I\u2019m wearing elbow-length muggers and unexamined joy - doctoring the weird! All is Blues rush and plexi, a bit mixed. No fear yet \u2014thunder is a blessing, the boat steals the gauntlet. My nerves are rapping, temporarily exhausting the clouds... \n￼S I D E - T R A C K (second mix) Wake, wake. This is your head doctor. We must be concrete now. No rush, no fear. Exhausting to step from dreams into another blessed arcade? You get so mixed. There are no muggers, no bagatelles. Waking is temporary? Balls! You need a summer holiday from plexi-fans. Blue Gauntlet, believe me these pills will see you examining the clouds. FINAL MIX Is this concrete, or unexamined dream? A plexi-question! Exhaust it in surrender. I can\u2019t wear waking, my head skis oK\\ the high canals. Fear is at elbow-length - will doctor turn mugger, or wave diverse gauntlets? Thunderous nerves! The Neil Young fans are singing \u20180 Steel Summer Cloudsj\u2018* I as they carry me waving to the Arcadian ball... \n￼/ Sunk sloop John B., I have to talk at you/ seeing you around no more. (Slid off the bridge, waved not.) Give me your due deaf ear & pardon, who hassled audience with Yeats before you was halfways great. Them dislocations still appeal - appalling high-minded & randy, compulsive chaser, awful and true. Suffered for it too - booming out & cringing in, rampant & trembling for thirty years. Resigned great shade, those ways are out: we dream o f reputation, and we fall in line. Well-mannered, discreet, soberly polishing the obvious \u2014Are thesefolks for real? you enquire. Who live by the word must be ready to die by it. Else not serious people. I don\u2019t want be badly & cracked! But that\u2019s the deal, But...for this Dream Song form, John, I need more lines - Thanks. Art, decency, sanity - can\u2019t square it? Loopy Cal, Mr Lowell toyou, scampered under my tree all afternoon, throwing up sticks. We laughed, werebrieflyhappy(5unmarked. Werenotallsobad.Therewereothers honed for the chop? One claimed dying was an art, did it so badly shefinally succeeded. And succeeded. And your fearful double Henry, sunk with his gripes & lust & glass? Yet raged & wept at McCarthy, the dying children in Delhi. And deluded Delmore, Anne who tolled too early - All you crazy bad and great: was Serious People, pal. Were you still with us I could not breathe, you being too much. Brow-beater - tearful, fearful, loyal & all - I take my leave. My times you urge and warn and flash dark lightning exact. I commit you & salute one friend of timing wayward, absolute. Homage to Master Berryman 60 \n￼Mexico \u2018Dona Barbara,que devora a los hombres' In the truck she let the Octopus open her shirt, also the blonde divorcee\u2019s - it was her dive through dark heat, she could not rise till everything was lifted from her. She had kept herself apart for years, virtuous, no affairs with lecturers as she surveyed the glittering surface and swell of Yanqui power. Night rose round her and she laughed, appalled, assenting as he gripped the blonde heads back, rinsed mouths with beer and marijuana. Out the window her hand spread, released wallet and I.D. What a burden righteousness becomes! The divorcee peeled mangos with her nails, licked dark fingers one by one before inserting them beneath her skirt. Cooler up front with the driver who drank white rum and kissed her eyes while he spoke poetry about the moon flowering over Vera Cruz, the shack where she could stay, indebted, in roses, good and chattel like his country to the Yanqui dollar. Headlights skewered the jungle, her eyes streamed. He spoke beautifully but was gentle-souled, was not the Octopus who devoured gringa. She buttoned her shirt and clambered back. The divorcee lay unconscious on the sacks, graceless, released. What had passed here? The Octopus shrugged. Self-respect had kept her on the surface all these years, buoyed up by her critique - time to meet what lay beneath.
