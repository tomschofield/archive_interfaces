I lie as still as someone balancing a bowl of fruit or rabbits on their head. Beside the pond my dog is gnawing bones that crawl with ants, and every now and then he stops to rub his lips and nose along the grass that closes over him. This afternoon aches like a bell, the sea is slow, and if you come and look for me beside the pool of melted water you will find a stone as cold and passionless as silk. Silk is the liquid stone my mother wore, I see it slipping, slipping, like a skin; I wear a scarf myself sometimes, I know, to hide the scar my mother made I do not want to show :^ my mother is afraid of love \n￼Hill Trembling 25-58 3/2/94 1:02 pm E0aje 39 - and I, her silver-skinned burnt only daughter - tissue-head, peculiar, queen of pain - I cry for kisses like she cries for shame. The sound of waves comes creeping through the house.
