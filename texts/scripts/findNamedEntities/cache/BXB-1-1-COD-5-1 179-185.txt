Fifteen stairs and an ill-fitting carpet. Somebody'll break their neck on it one day, Father liked to say, neck like a bull's whom a fall down several flights would scarcely damage, head like a gorilla's, hide like an elephant's, almost certainly bullet-proof. Caspar with his muskets and curious hound. What a noiSe. What had they drunk or what stuporhad they ad  ministered to one another in marital embrace that they did not wake in alarm and stand in their night-clothes or, worse, naked, at the head of the stairs, shining a lamp and shouting who's there? Caspar in the lamplight, blinking, trailing his guns. Didn't they? Didn't Father, standing gigantic and Caspar horri  fied at the sight, behind the dazzle, of so much hair and flesh, did not ivather roar first with laughter at his murdering son, first with laughter and then with rage, and advancing, descend  ing a stair or two, put the flat of one great naked foot on Cas  par's beaten head and almost gently, with a leisurelypush, topp  le him backwards, him and the dog and guns? You reached the door, eh Caspar, didn't you? xou reached their breathing door, their door ajar through which issued their hog- snorings. Jo would have it no less, tie reached their door, he stood on the landing doubled up for breath, hearing their sleeping noises in his listening right ear and hearing, feeling throughout himself, his own heart thudding like a mine-engine. Weren't you scared? Scared? He was weeping with it, teeth chattering with it, he was fumbling and snivelling with it. He'll wake, our Dad'll wake, he'll rip me up. He blundered in, into the parental bedroom, where mother and Father, despite his noise and the occasional bark from Blood, were still asleep, heavily, snoring but invisible. And Caspar stood in the dark at the bed-end, trying to get his breath. His hand, her hand, his hand, her hand tightly gripping the black bar, the knuckles showing white, Jo giggling and the bed-knobs rattling, rell us, she begs him, tell us again, tell us again and again. How the dark did make it easier, and perhaps a faint white  ness of pillows at the far end, the dark and the swinish snoring in it, at close range, closer than a fun-fair. Took up the first, 179 \n￼so she got him to tell her again, took up the first, of two barrels, laid it with a clatter over the iron bed-end, pleased to be relieved of its weight,, his shoulder too low, holding the great thing feebly, vaguely, his shivering knocking iron against iron and all the brass bedknobs in a fright. Fired. The recoil wrencned the shotgun from his hands, clatter  ed it backwards over his shoulder. The room exploded with noise, noise hurtled off the windows and the looking-glass, seized and rattled the bed. Human noise, my Caspar's frightened shout. Jo looks him in the eyes: God's truth? God's only truth. Her bright eyes, her giggling lips. Cross your heart? I cross ray heart. Her hand on his white hand. Lick it, wipe it. My finger's wet, my finger's dry, cut mythroat if l tella lie. Father bullet-proof. Father though bloodyand full of shotstill capable of nailing Caspar to the beams.So the canny lad took up the second gun and fired before the perturbation from the first had ceased, one trigger first- save one for Blood, his guardian angel whispered- but more than blood he feared his risen dad and fired again. Con  secutive world's ends. Din desperate for an exit. Then only smell, and silence collecting itself, the gun with its brother gun empty on the floor, the Jack Russell stunned with terror against, nis feet. And slowly, ac whon a\u2014train,\u2014oloaring the viaduct and headi-ng off north or-oouth like the glasses in Lilian's bar that shiver to a standstill after a big express has cleared the viaduct and headed off north or south into the night, slowly the brass bed quietened too. And Caspar did not wait to hear it begin to drip. You've got to get out yet, Caspar, she says, got to get out and go on the roads like a proper Romany and then you meet me. But there he is in her Aunty's house in Bangley Park, clapping a hand on hers and thrilling the little bed-knobs, so he must have got out, alsatian or no alsatian. Blood was loose in the yard somewhere in the dark. From the front door or the back door it was thirty yards or so to the nearest gate. Caspar oh-o-c-e the stick weighted with lead that his father used to finish off half  dead rabbits and then went st- althily- why stealthily?- from the back door to the front and to the back again, puzzled William at his heels. Caspar could see through the storm windows in either porch out into the wasteland of the family's property. There was not much moon; where Blood was amid the old iron, the empty crates 180 \n￼and the broken carts, he could not see. To make matters worse, the brute had fallen silent. Caspar made preparations to escape. He felt in the pockets of his father's evil-smelling topcoat which hung by the door where the guns were kept, as heavy a presence almost as the man himself, and found some small change and a half sovereign. His mother's handbag lay open on the kitchen table, he rifled it but found nothing much. From the larder he took bread and cheese and a knuckle of ham, cramming his pockets with them. Then he could not postpone his attempt any longer. He must be gone from the house and miles away before first light. Where was Blood? Caspar listened at both doors but could hear jathe least sound of the dog he knew to be loose in the yard. He dared not go upstairs to spy from a bedroom window. He must leave. He wished the chance had never been given him. He wished he were in the kennel with William and Blood in the yard outside snuffling and pawing at the bolt but unable to get in. He went irresolutely to and fro, muttering to himself and gripping hard on the heavy stick. William trotted after him, worried and baffled. The dark house was horrible, he must leave; but outside, silent and invisible, the guard-dog was listening and watching. Beyond the fence there were tne flat straight roads, leading to freedom in every direction. How he would run, he and the little terrier, away, too far away ever to be caught by man or dog. Before dawn he would be somewhere safe. Caspar began to hear noises in the house, only rats no doubt or a breath of wind in the chimney. Was there any wind? He look  ed out again, craning his neck for a sight of the sky. The yell  ow and shapeless moon lay in the path of a travelling cloud. Caspar swore a solemn oath to himself that he would go when the cloud had swallowed the moon, it was elongated, shark-shaped, up there at least there was a breeze and the cloud, the moon's de- vourer, was moving rapidly. The moon looked yellow, lolling to one side, peaked in her features, feeble in light. Caspar felt sick, his chances were poor, best to lie down on the hearthrug a-g-ai-n before the dead fire and hope to die. Then the terrier, t-ri^-th-e-n always under his feet, left him. Caspar continued star  ing at the purposeful cloud: a few more yards, miles of sky perhaps, but yards, seconds. Thirty yards from the door to the fence. 181 \n￼william had left him. Caspar heard him in the dark at the foot of the stairs. He was growling; but the undertone of that would-be menacing sound was a whine of the purest terror. The growl was deep in the throat but continually a whine and whim  per broke through into the higher reaches. The stairs in the dark; the terrier facing upstairs and whimpering with fear. Then the cloud leapt upon the fEEhiKxnanBiax stricken moon, there was a last moment of feeble radiance and the long body of the cloud could be seen in its blackness. Then a dark sky, undiffer  entiated. William began to howl, howl like a child, his courage broken, and Caspar hit on a strategem and acted. He opened the front door noisily and wide, paused for ten or fifteen seconds and slammed it shut. Then ran, calling for William, ran full tilt through the hall in the dark, through the kitchen, screaming for William to come, flung open the door, the back door, where his father's heavy coat hung and the guns were kept, and ran, ran full pelt down the cluttered filthy path, to the more than man- high gate and got his fingers, still EiHiKhing grasping the stick, got sufficient fingers into the mesh, and heaved, and set his right foot on the massive padlock, and kicked his way to a secure hold above and hoisted himself higher. Blood, a shadow, utterly silent, leaped from an arc of speed and seized his foot. My Caspar screamed, tugged. Sockless, too small for the boot, his foot, which was only beginning to be rivetted, came free. He swung himool-f over the gate, he turned. How had he imagined things would be? That he would be able to lift the terrier bodily over a gate he himself was obliged to climb? Tkopo there might be a place in the fence through which a Jack Russell could squeeze but not an alsatian? That there would be time? William, following pretty close, had his one real chance in the moment when Blood was fastening his teeth into Caspars foot. In that moment he leaped as high as he could at ohe wire of the gate, but fell back. There was time for one more leap as Blood shook the pierced boot from his jaws. Caspar, aloft, leaned down; but with  out the impetus of the run from the door William did less well. Still Caspar, with outstretched fingers, touched his head. Then there was no more time. Caspar leaned down, flailing with the heavy stick, and struck the alsatian across the spine; but this was not enough. Blood merely dragged the terrier to a safe dis- 182 \n￼tance. Caspar hur ed the stick, but it fell uselessly. He could not see what was happening. He sat on the top of the gate swearing and weeping. He began to lower himself back into the yard, thinking to take up the heavy stick and fight Blood; but at that moment he heard, with a terrible distinctness, the al- satian's jaws breaking William's neck. Caspar fell from the gate, to safety, and vomited. When Jo asked to see the holes in Caspar's ankle he was will  ing and able to oblige, Of course, they were not holes by then but the marks of puncture, one either side, that he would have for ever, he said. He first showed them to her on a day when they had been talking about these things in the hospital, and she looked at them solemnly. The next time was when he took off his boots to sleep with her in the copse after their escape from the wards. Then however he was not thinking of William and Blood and it was Jo herself who took off his sock and with cool and savagely bittenjfingertips touched the two slight cavities on either side behind the ankle bone. I have seen them myself more than once. When he first came in and had his shower he sat on the bench in the grey wash-house and lifted up that foot, his left foot, and rested it on his other knee. There can be no doubt about the holes. They are clearer now, as holes, than they were then, he says. For then there were also lacerations, though not deep, where the teeth tore the skin as the boot came off. loose. Dragging that bare foot, once he could stand without retching, Caspar set off down the night roads. There was no sound from the alsatian. When Caspar glanced back he saw only the outline of the house in darkness. He would have been terrified, but not surprised, to see the upstairs windows suddenly blaze with lights. Then the moon i-llumincd ttr escaped the cloud and illum  ined greyly the dead straight road. It was a road north, but he soon.left it, fearing some form or another of pursuit, and bore away westwards on tracks that even in daylight he would not have been familiar with. When for fatigue and pain he could not go any further he pushed through a hedge and entered a wood, going in deeper and deeper, and on dry pine needles, on a cushiony bed, lay down. More than ever now, more than at any time in his life, Caspar wished himself dead. His foot throbbed and burned, the pain of it 183 \n￼ran in stiff callipers up his leg, and when he closed his eyes he saw Blood, the shadow, launch through the air and he felt the man-trap jaws snapping on his boot. He grieved over the death of William and blamed himself. He needn't have- but I looked him in the eyes when he said what he was forever saying about a Romany and his dog, and saw his conscience goading him. Later he made things worse, after he had lost Jo too, and he would tell any  one who cared to listen that he had run with the terrier in his arms for the gate and that, seeing the alsatian coming round the house, he had thrown his burden down, as a lure, decoy or sop, and had climbed the gate whilst William was being killed and had escaped thus with only a flesh wound in his left heel. Dog had no chance anyway, he said, couldna 've got myself over the gate and him and all. Wouldn't of got clear myself but for him. He died in a good cause as you might say. Number one. And not a bad way to go. Quick, any road. But he told Jo he should have run with the little dog in his arms and flung him over first and made the best of it himself using his father's stick. He told me he'd tried his best and it weren't good enough. But in the heart of the wood, sleeping in a cold delirium, he heard time and time again the sounds of the death of the terrier he had slept with summer and winter night after night and woken with and hug  ged when they heard outside their prison and ark the enemy Blood, the wolf, the frustrated assassin. So he came out of the wood after two days and two more nights, having eaten all his few provisions and with his foot turned sep- tic. Sat in the market -pl-aoe in Withern or some such beauty\u2014 sqxrt, before anyone else was up, sat on a bench, nursing his foot, head bowed, his lawyer's son's jacket and trousers ripped and muddy, leaves in his hair, his mouth unable to stop muttering. He was lucky, he was very lucky. It was a Sunday and the parson found him, crossing the square to his church. Asked no questions but heard from Caspar, unasked, that he had blood on his hands, still asked no questions and heard no more lies. He was lucky it was a parson, not the Law, and that the parson was a simple Christian man. I envy him. It never came my way to help a lad like that. 1 nev  er walked across a square first thing in the morning and found a youngster in need and took him in, asking no questions, took him home and kept the congregation, never more than a handful for first 184 \n￼185 communion, waiting. Never took anyone home, i've often thought with envy of him charitably receiving Caspar into his unmarried home. What a Sunday. How he must have prayed, how he must have sung his thanksgiving, knowing my Caspar was at home there be  ing looked after by the housekeeper, Caspar cleaned and his wound dressed and his body clothed in cast-off but decent clothes given to the parson by parishoners and held by for just such an occasion. Or perhaps he had no housekeeper and did for himself and sent a message by the milkman to tell those few waiting for the first communion that there wouldn t be one and to come back for the second, and perhaps then in the couple of hours grace this gave him he bathed the boy himself, heaping the manky clothes for incineration, careless of *tender towards sores, and applied painful iodine to the suppurating foot and bade him, again and again, be silent about the blood on his hands, there was none and the thought of it would pass, cave him porridge and tea.
