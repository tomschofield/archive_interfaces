Supposing the coat is a monk, and the sofa\u2019s a young horse; and supposing the photos are real? Darling, I love you. I want to stay here in the dark for ever. Everyone, don\u2019t talk and move around. \u2018A strange lamented artist who loves dancing.\u2019 Somebody\u2019s clock. I hate her. Cold white lines. Cut light in concave triangles, the door, the side of the door, the panel\u2019s lonely back. I think I am a sponge. I think I\u2019m going. Or shall I write in code again? Who cares. She was descending like a boneless swan. I wish more people would descend like that. She knows I\u2019m writing about her. Now she\u2019s gone. Mr C. is calling. Here I am, hidden in my wooden hold of doors. Last night G. told me everything. It\u2019s true: I will always remember you, G., I really will. I wanted to tell you about...I nearly did. She asked me if I masturbate. Wet grass. Hepburn - \u2018fragile, feminine\u2019 - please die. Rays of light returning on themselves. Glossy prints of Rudolf Nureyev. Taut purity of virgins in white landscapes, overwhelmed by tenderness. Don\u2019t go. \u201cLike drugfj,\u201d he said, \u201cthe same basic principle.\u201d \u2018Rebellion itselfs a form of love.\u2019 Obsession with counting birds. My lips are aching. They have taken away my Lord. The Head is calling. \n￼Hill Trembling 59-94 3/2/94 1:42 pm P0,23b 53 - Marine crustaceans\u2019 seven leg-like mouths. Goodwin\u2019s MOODS AND TENSES. Pipe tobacco. \u2018Little did the author know.\u2019 Plisetskaya. I wonder if I\u2019m good at telling lies. \u2018Un homme secret, il danse dans la rue.\u2019 I do not know the rules. Oh yes you do! \u201cWhat\u2019s she really like?\u201d She is a virgin. Yellow parrots, lettuce, nylon wool. I went back to the study after supper. The bluebells are in session in the woods. Wearing dresses frightens me. Calves. Nipples. The teachers smell of beans and dressing-gowns. The dark proud gentleness of feathers reflected in the dancer\u2019s famous face. Her hair is gold. She hates the other partner. Black satin, tinsel, armaments unfold. She didn\u2019t know she made me cry. I told her. Broad hands. Dark blood. A little milk and rice. Down down down to the creator of diamonds and coal and roots in silver tights. Beaten cut tormented killed and counter-killed. This isn\u2019t what you think. It\u2019s radioactive. Many men and unknown things go down there. Won\u2019t write about the walk. Past. Frozen colour. Noises echo through the whitened squares. \u2018Mauriac choisit Emmanuelle.\u2019 Hiding during meals - the seventh day. I won\u2019t be watched so much by people later. \u2018Slowness Is Beauty\u2019 - always at top speed. \u201cI simply came to see if you\u2019re alright...\u201d \u2018Suppressed depression, iron will\u2019 - that\u2019s me! \u201cYou\u2019ll burn your journal next year - DEFINITELY.\u201d Her fatherland.
