Stoking-up, you flesh that sparse contracted source. The flame-points swell with wings and cobbled smoke. Masking a fist, you weave-in half-burnt wood - tuff of lichens to fissure in fire - and stand away, watching how the falling-up of heat DAVIDMORLEY washorninBlackpoolin1964. He read Zoology at Bristol University and wrote a Ph.D. on environmental science at London University. Before moving to Shef  field, he lived at Bowness, from where he carried out a research programme into the impact of acid rain on Cumbrian lakes and tarns, in 1989 he won a major Eric Gregory Award.

A sculptor works less openly, releasing stone in secret, scraping through caves to find a captive, hands like drills. The binds of stone shrivel to his touch: a plying flame as fumbles out of smoke. He makes his fist a phoenix; hands he turns are wings that clench a fire, a beak that bites is chisel in this stone... The warm wings lift a trembling limb from rock: a dust, like smoke, veers into air. Errand 1came to a place where buildings were going up; biscuits of slate sat wrapped in twine. Earth moved like sugar, boiling against the metal of a dumper. A machine dropped, dropped its yellow snout, mizzling at joists it hammered-in. W hen I got to my father 1 would learn the heat of that impact, how you might light paper from it two hours on... The air meanwhile would shiver with fire, a fineless dust, the shouts of impact.

Not visored, he stood out from that coven \n￼DAVID MOKI.EV 73 of kneeled and sparking men like something they were making or melting to start over. We went out to sandpiles, pounded stone, his eyes spindling, his mouth asking and asking why I was there. Metal-work The lathe we were at kept cutting-out in little deaths; our anger slid. Under a blade sheet-metal split. I stood where my father stood me: this side of a lathe. Weathers of dust fell to a hush at my feet. 1 did what he asked: watched calipers twitch legs skinny^ an avocet\u2019s; but looked beyond: to drill-heads primed, fluted like wands of steel. Ile halved the work: held mandrels, clamp. Drills spoke for him, talked themselves out. \n￼74 DAVID HORLRY Air Street Deer-tracks \u2014I followed them: made a forest slide through a deer\u2019s eye; felt for myself the trodden dints of hoof, shorthand codes cut on the frost... Pitch of night: insurgent shrews scatter in dissidence between owls. My torch-beam welds them to the ground; I could gather them like moss. The air as well, corrupt with movement, walks with me like gravity and, step-by-step, it flenses sound to whispers of a deer-cut. Where the tracks street together - passes of a scalpel - with torch-light off, eyes wide for catlight, I read their musks like creosote andsawthedeer- aherdoften- scent me there, and go. Morning took me southwards; levelled on fat curving rails, restive station platforms, ticks of rain. As if trespassing I cut the close-wire of people. Gundogs grabbed me at traffic-lights. Gamekeepers in Downing Street met my stare. It was night delivered me this: a street lit by nothing - near where I could sleep - \n￼1)AVII> MORLEY 75 with a name like nothing: AIR.

Remembering rain: how a single droplet breaks its back on the hurrying window of a No. 3 bus. Or the fly: simmering on vibrated glass, intellectual, in that spiderless prison... A man in corduroys unscrews a flask and shares warm tea with a woman he hated. H e does not see a fly browse on the brim of their plastic mug, or the way raindrops garrotte the nerves of his rheumatic wife. We are sick with fear the drunk will miss his stop, lolling over the seatback, leaving it our decision. Jerusalem Hallymurphy painted white, inside and out; road-blocked suburbs, then the accomplishment of a bounding wall to stop the desert\u2019s abstract itch. This achieved, we grew fluent in our dialogues: the limit on sense was vox pop, as was ambivalence about a noun for boredom. Came the day a master of lexicography \n￼76 DAVII) MOItI.EV motorbike-jumped the lower wall-sectors and made off for the border. He was taken alive, displayed in the central archives (after public vasectomy and grammar - confiscation), writing, rewriting in blackened sand, Lift up your hearts and sing. The Politicisation of the North Wind We came out safe, under the aspens; wanted the road south, but winds deflected our point of reference to the motorway. A Police Rover winks on its orbit round an arterial lane. Cobs of leaf-litter give way to a blackbird\u2019s enquiry. Ivy dripfeeds an oak, as if accidentally. We need the road south, but accidents are happening. A rescue party sifts the rubble of falling leaves; a hand of the law harries us down turn-offs - its flickered blue flame; a kestrel makes its one-off bid in a plunging market. We circle a bend with a sign saying Motorway Regulations Terminate Here. Aspens. Wind. Regulations terminate here. Enniskillen There was a speedboat ploughing up Lough Erne, an activity 1 thought the local RUC would take no shine to. I watched three little grebes make with the rhythm. Imagine my discomfiture when the boatman waved then a four-eyed warden told me to push off. I plucked up my fag-ends, enough, never enough; followed lager cans to the centre of Enniskillen, \n￼DAVII) MORLEY 77 a place, now, infamous as Walsingham, and slirine to all discomfiture. I felt a lot for a heaven whose latest queue still wore their Remembrance poppies as though they\u2019d just left the nave where the priest held back, half-listening for - rain.

Signs direct you to the City Elder. Nothing will grow under her rule, as Signs will tell you at every corner. But when she invites you to her Ice Festival you will learn to love Slowfreeze and Nightflake, her daughters by sunless adoption. Will they dance, dance with you? Only so slowly unless they melt at the heart from a heat of ecstasy. The parquet is white, white. You are falling out of life. Their images are locked in you forever. You will carry them, bright on your lips, even over oceans, to your own easy gardens. One night you may wake before dawn, walk naked to where the river thaws in its grave.

Meanwhile, talk of weather or the terrible storm damage. Avoid words like informer, auditor, police. There are things in the wall very like ears. Their microphones are wonderful as knots in wood. Listen, someone can sell you at the slightest notice rabid for evidence. To ask you to repeat after them, a dream of snow, cold hands holding you, which you love; that lift you to where water rushes over your face. Will you dance, dance? Only so slowly. Melting, melting.
