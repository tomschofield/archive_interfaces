Ashley Halpe, Professor of English at Peradeniya University, introduced me to the Sigiri Graffiti, showed me some of his own versions, and encouraged me to persevere. Anuradha Seneviratne, Professor of Sinhaia at Peradeniya, gave me instruction on the Old Sinhaia texts, including their background, and critical advice on my adaptations. Senake Bandaranaike, Professor of Archaeology at Kelaniya University and Director of the Sigiriya Project, provided me with much information and special access to the Mirror Wall and the Frescoes.

WD \n￼^HSyrlS Preface <a\u2014 Much of my happy childmod was spent in Ceylon, where my father was the last British Mayor of Colombo. After a gap of fifty years, I returned to Sri Lanka, and found the inspiration for these poems. It came from songs written in Old Sinhaia during the 8th, 9th and 10th centuries. The original holographs remain on the curving, parapet w'all of a footpath half way up the rock fortress of Sigiriya in the central province. The wall is about a hundred metres long, and over tu;o metres high. Incised with rnetal styles in the polished plaster, the songs relate to mysterious, \"golden'\u2019 women in frescoes painted on the undulating rock above this \"mirror w-all\", who seem to be dancing in the clouds. Twenty of these portraits have survived since the end of the 5th century. □ Sigiriya , or Sihigiri in Old Sinhaia, means Lion Rock : and the Sinhaia people are the 'lion* people, mythically descended from a lion who raped an Indian princess. From some directions, the rock resembles a crouching lion that has lost its head: and from others, a massive lingam, the symbol of Shiva. Rising 600 feet above the forest, tanks and paddy fields of the peneplain, it stands on the island\u2019s main water parting, where the rivers that flow east into the Bay of Bengal part from those that flow west into the Indian Ocean. Q Sigiriya was fortified by a king called Kassapa or Kasyapa, who reigned there from AD 477-4. the only king of Lanka to have done so. The Mahawamsa, an ancient Therevada Buddhist chronicle written in Pali, accused Kassapa of slaying his father by having him sealed up in a niche inside a wall: brcA-t: 2 3 b ( 2,VKt* IS-11Jo vtaAvVs c*/ntv«s\\ \n￼and said tTiat he chose Sigiriya through fear , because the rock is difficult of ascent for human beings. He cleared (the land) round about, surrounded it with a wall and built a staircase in the form of a lion. Thence it took its narne...^ Then he built there a fine palace, worthy to behoki, like another Aiakamanda and dwelt there like Kuvera:/ Q Kuvera was the god of wealth in the Hindu pantheon, and rUakamanda, or Aiaka in Sanskrit, was the city he occupied on the mythical Mount Kailasa in the Himalayas. The Sanskrit poet Kaiidasa, who lived a century before Kassapa, alludes to Kailasa as the mirror for goddesses\u2019^ and to Alaka as adorned with paintings he compares o the cloud's rainbow. Four of the Sinhaia songs refer to the women in the frescoes as asaran, from apsaras in Sanskrit, the cloud nymphs who frequented Kailasa. One song suggests they were the king's five hundred wives. Were they *stuck to the rock as offerings to Kuvera or the Lion or the local mountain god? Perhaps their function was to ensure sufficient rainfall to grow rice in this dry zone: rain was sometimes regarded as the semen of the gods. Q After Kassapa was defeated in battle by his half- brother, Sigirya was abandoned as a royal residence, but greatly revered as a place of secular pilgrimage. People were drawn there from all over Sri Lanka and southern India for the next seven hundred years. Eventually the ruins were smothered in jungle, until the site was opened up in the last century. 1) Some of the writers signed their names on the wall, declaring their rank, profession and place of residence. They were members of a feudal nobility and its entourage; officials, merchants, clerks and Buddhist monks. Only two of the authors professed to be *poet:> . At least twel ve poems were written brtilc.uhv- 3X1 ||5 ULrftfcdl \n￼by women. Monks had occupied Sigiriya centuries before Kassapa's reign, and remained for centuries thereafter. In some of their puritanical songs, they condemned the fresco nymphs as faithless wives or prostitutes or dancing girls. Theravada Buddhism never encouraged erotic art or sensual passion. I The women in the pictures were seen by the writers from various contradictory points of view, but never rearing children. War, famine, plague, or what we might call reality, did not enter into their stylised world. Nor was it necessary to describe what could be seen on the spot. No song implies that Kassapa was a parricide, though several argue about his wives' behaviour after his death. There is no definitive version of why the women are on the rock, or what they are doing, or who they are: and the songs grow from this fertile mystery. □ Called gi in Sinhaia, the lyrics were sung, perhaps with vina, flute and drums, in the gallery under the portraits where they were written. There are poems about love, rejection and the separation of lovers; satires and complaints; joyful, erotic celebrations; and rueful ironies. Much of the writing is light verse or vers de societe. There' is at least one prose inscription, which says: I am Budal, I came in company and saw Sihigiri. Many people who saw fBihigirij have written verses. I therefore did not write one. Q The forms of the gi are syllabic: usually 38 to 43 syllables, divided into two lines, each of which contains a \"breath\", or caesura, after 9, 10 or 11 syllables. An English quatrain could match this, but Sinhaia verse has no stresses. End rhymes are rare, though internal rhyming, assonance and alliteration frequently occur. Some short Sinhaia words can have several meanings that deepen the ambiguity, or the irony of a lyric. br«2-Vc 1 \n￼n A few of my poems are versions that keep close to the syllabic count and meaning of their Old Sinhaia sources. But more often 1 use a variety of freer forms to elaborate images and ideas evoked by the sources; to bring in modern voices; to include some description and context; or to combine material from several songs. My sources are among the 685 songs that were transcribed, edited, translated and introduced by Senarat Paranavitana in his Sigiri Graffiti, a two volume masterpiece of Sinhaia scholarship, which informed and inspired my work. xvi. a \n￼i, xvii ✓i- \n￼\n￼TITAX \n￼\n￼yiy*n C-eAwi Invocation 3# .bold IS IS lbAtC>5 All you feel on the Lion Rock won't come by breathing heavily.
