He has done so not only by virtue of what he about Ireland, but because he is such a good poet. It may also be signifies that his poetry mediated between traditionalism and Modernism at an important juncture in twentieth-century poetry. MacNeice's relation to Ireland and England, to Yeats and Eliot, and to his 1930s contemporaries make:his poetry a remarkably broad conduit for the materials and techniques of twentieth-century poetry. And a conduit too for its crises of faith: one theme of n^C|*aper will be the different ways in which MacNeice, Derek Mahon and Paul Muldoon have reinterpreted the tension between poetry and history. This tension they inherited more immediately from Yeats, further back from English Romanticism and the aesthetic tradition. Vi t*s Yet not only MacNeice's 'Anglo' dimension but Yeats's c-as sometimes be*marginalised or criticised in accounts of 'Irish poetry1. After Independence there was increasingly no Yeatsian constituency in the Free State/Republic. And as Yeats's indigenous cultural context became more remote do too did certain aspects of the Irish-British.literary connection. In terms of poetic history, we must not forget that the Celtic Twilight fogged up the entire archipelago. Again, from the other side of the Irish Sea, the impact of Yeats on English poets - W.H. Auden, Philip Larkin - has not always been understood. Here the connection is largely to do with form, with formal traditionalism, with the 'ancient ' in which Yeats insisted poetry should be packed lest it turn into slush. In The Poetry of W.B. Yeats (1941) MacNeice draws a firm formal circle around Yeats, Auden and himselfWe admired Yeats too for his form. Eliot ---------- iin 1921 had argued that, as the modern world is so complex, the poet \n￼-2- must become \"more allusive, more indirect, in order to force, to dislocate if necessary, language into his meaning\". A chaotic world, that is, could only be dealt with by the methods of The Waste Land. Yeats went back to an earlier tradition and suggested by his example that, given a chaotic world, the poet is entitled, if he wishes, to eliminate some of the chaos, to select and systematize. Treatment of form and subject m here went hand in hand. Yeats's formalising activity began when he thought about the world; as he thought it into a regular pattern, he naturally fV?c-c££ cast his verse in regular patterns also. A parallel peeifl3 can be observed in W.H. Auden ''' 'j At the same time, as we shall see, MacNeice also assimilated The Waste Land§l.challenge to such 'formalising activity1. But my immediate i point is that Yeats's posterity has been more dispersed thafy Eliot's. Indeed, the prominence of Modernism in academic theorising of twentieth- century poetry may owe something to the comparative absence of a Yeatsian opposition. Critics sometimes loosely refer to Yeats as a 'modernist' because they think he ->.,ght to fit the bill. But poets pick up what critics miss. And if contexts Yeats went down the plughole of Irish separation from Britain, it's not surprising that Northern Irish poets, born into uneasy cultural dualities, should home not only towards MacNeice's 'treatment of form and subject', but also Yeats's. 2 I have argued elsewhere^ that some poets from the Free State emulated Eliot and partly as a means of asserting their independence respegt both English poetry and Yeats and the Revival. However, their imitations of American Modernism were less significant than Patrick Kavanagh's invention of an indigenous free verse in The Great Hunger and Lough Derg. (We hear its sounds developed today in the poetry of Paul Durcan.) But in the case of MacNeice we have an Irish poet strategically \n￼I s'tior) -3- placed to weigh Yeats against Eliot, and traditionalism against Modernism. On the one hand, his cultural affiliation to Yeats went much deeper than Auden's; on the other, a poet from Ireland encountered Eliot in a context - 1930s Britain - which enforced a re-examination of the formal means whereby poetry could cope with historical pressures. His successors attend to MacNeice because MacNeice attended to his predecessors. This genealogical awareness is itself an Irish trait. Though a less devout ancestor-worshipper than Yeats, MacNeice warned in his essay 'Poetry Today' (1935) against the abolition of tradition: '[poets and readers] must avoid the two extremes of psittacism and aphasia. There are cultured people in England today who write poems which are ^^r-^and sheer She111-,\u2022 these are psittacists ; they are IaJO betraying themselves (and, incidentally, betraying Shelley). There are also the enthusiasts (mostly Americans in Paris) who set out to scrap tradition from A. to Z; this should logically lead to asphasia; that they do not become quite aphasic is due to their powers of self-deception. How are we to do justice, not to the segregated Past or Preseat, but to their concrete antinomy? in terms which one would now call post-modernist: 'The problem is especially difficult for us because, unlike our more parochial predecessors, we have so many Pasts and Presents to choose from.,N^ have too much choice 2 and not enough brute limitations. The ; ' ; is usually iw r\u2019cie./i' . But MacNeice does not seek relief from creative 'impotence' in notions of the self-pleasing text. His solution is 'clique-literature' i.e. interaction between a group of contemporaries. MacNeice's Irishness sharpened his sense both of poetic community and poetic tradition. His book Modern Poetry (1938) is the critical work which most obsessively addresses the point where the poet's own generation activates that 'concrete MacNeice goes on to frame this \n￼-4- antinomy of Past and present'. And none of his English contemporaries discriminated so carefully between what he could use and what he could not in the practice and theory of Yeats and Eliot\u2022. Nor did any Irish poet subject ^eats to such detailed interrogation. They mostly dealt i with anxiety of Yeatsian influence by psittacism (F.R. Higgins) or by would-be aphasia (Austin Clarke). Measured from the 1930s MacNeice regarded Yeats, Eliot and even Joyce as still unduly implicated in aestheticism, in U- 'Pater's closed circ:^ of exacted moments'. He considered that Auden and himself had more thoroughly broken the aesthetic circuit by virtue of their attention, not only to subject-matter and history, but also to language. MacNeice always stresses the social contexts of the language that reaches the poet: language as a wcommunity-product^,Aby the vulgar* social and political world. would not have accepted that this world was already textually inscribed or pre-empted. For instance, he Sndcri'HJ . Geoffrey (\\/Vj&sc dislike of Ezra Pound's 1cultural-reference K.5 rock-jumpingstylecriticised the'monstrouscadences' of Pound's free verse.J For MacNeice, poetic rhythms must listen to the speech and sounds that invade the poet's ear. And he also belied that * the thirties poets, in their resumption of traditional forms, could now take in their stride 'techniques previously pursued for their own sake by experimenters'^. 'Poetry Today' ends with MacNeice's sense of the formal and metaphysical issues in the 1930s: / 'We [poets] want to have the discoveries of other poets in our blood but not necessarily in our minds. We want just enough a priori to make us ruthless so that when we receive the inrush of a posteriori (commonly called \"life\"), we can sweep away the vastly greater part of it and let the rest cut our potential pattern; by the time this is done, it will be not only \n￼a new but the first pattern of its kind and not particularly ours'.^ MacNeice's early poems worry at the problem of closure; or, to use his own terminology, flux and pattern. His poem 'Birmingham', for instance, veers between journalism and symbolism as MacNeice gives the inrush of city life its metaphorical and rhythmic head: 'On shining lines the trai like vast sarcophggi mor4'. The double medium of eight-line stanza - very different from Yeats's - and massively irregular cornfclet suggests a poet who is remaking forms. MacNeice says in The Poetry of W.B. Yeats: rV 9.-W V g 'At all costs Yeats avoided flux - the sphere of the realist Throughout MacNeice's thirties poetry we hear flux invading pattern with sentence-structures as well as data that belong to the sphere of realist prose. Auden's poetry retains more stanzaic system (also more philosophical system) and sometimes become rhythmically formulaic . MacNeice, responding to flux 'On the tongue, on the eyes, on the ears, in the pallms of one's hands', retextured form from the inside out. His comments on free verse,. ('Some traditional verse forms are like ladders with rungs every few inches; you get stuck in them or stub your toes on them. But a ladder without mediation between the two kinds of ladder. Autum Journal (1939) metrically and structurally consummates MacNeice's early dialectic between flux and pattern. It simultaneously re-opens channel^*between Modernist poetry and history. In his earlier 'Eclogue for Christmas', which both JUnift- and deviates from The Waste Land, MacNeice had criticised the abstract direction of Modernist forms: I who was harlequin in the child hood of the century, , Posed by Picasso beside an endless opaque sea, have seen myself sifted and splintered in broken facets, Tentative pencillings, endless liabilities, no assets, Abstractions scalpelled with a palette-knife Without reference to this particular life ... ' . \n￼-6- du> Autumn Journal might be called 'Beyond The Waste Land' the poem confronts twentieth-century splinters (and London in pre-war rather than post-war crisis) with a ' humnaism and a flexible verse-medium that swings between closure and openness. In section XVI of the poem, however, Ireland figures as a set of attempts to freeze history: 'Let the round tower stand aloof / in a world of bursting mortar!' This underlines the extent to which MacNeice's formal as well as philosophical procedures were the product of a reaction against Irish absoluteness. Yet he stops short of relativising the imagination into the closed circuit of infinitely deconstructible texts. We can see the importance of this for his successors ■ !< jfid P'i\u2019j-' by considering how poems by Mahon, Muldoon rC- A have received his celebrated poem 1Snow'.J In the final section of Autumn Journal MacNeice himself rewrites 'Snow', placing the poem at a receding historical point: n Sfc'eep my past and all my sins, In distant -snow or dried roses ... But the great quality of 'Snow' is its perennial immediacy. \n￼-7- The room was suddenly rich and the great bay-window was Spawning snow and pink roses against it Soundlessly collateral and incompatible: World is suddener than we fancy it. World is crazier and more of it than we think, Incorrigibly plural. I peel and portion A tangerine and spit the pips and feel The drunkenness of things being various. And the fire flames with a bubbling sound for world Is more spiteful and gay than one supposes - On the tongue on the eyes on the ears in the palms of one's hands - There is more than glass between the snow and the huge roses. 'Suddenness' and 'fancy' are versions of flux and pattern. The challenge of suddenness to fancy poses questions about the Conjunctive powers of poetry itself. Can it follow and fathom what is \u2018between the snow and the huge roses? Mahon and Muldoon, too, accept the challenge of life's disjunctions to poetic conjunction, of 'incorrigible' plurality to the aesthetic rage for order. The poems in which they refer to 'Snow' are Mahon's elegy for MacNeice, 'In Carrowdore Churchyard' (written in 1964), and Muldoon's 'History' (published in Why Brownlee Left, 1980). In the last stanza of the former, 'Snow' comes to epitomise MacNeice's whole poetic enterprise; the whole enterprise of poetry: Locked in the winter's fist, these hills are hard As nails, yet soft and feminine in their turn t When fingers open and the hedges burn. This, you implied, is how we ought to live - The ironical, loving crush of roses against snow, Each fragile, solving ambiguity. So From the pneumonia of the ditch, from the ague Of the blind poet and the bombed-out town you bring The all-clear to the empty holes of spring; Rinsing the choked mud, keeping the colours new. Mahon's oxymoronic adjectives reproduce the paradoxical poise, the metaphysical conundrum of MacNeice's poem. But the stanza goes on to claim that poetry can in some sense 'solve' or at least sieve the 'inrush' of phenomena and history. Rhythmically and rhetorically it moves beyond 'ambiguity'. \n￼Paul Muldoon's 'History' is partly a joke against rigid understandings of history in Ulster and Ireland. It indirectly attacks the assumption that poem we can 'remember' 1690 or never forget 1916. From the outset the > historical memory and its selective priorities: Where and when exactly did we first have sex? Do you remember? Was it Fitzroy Avenue, Or Cromwell Road, or Notting Hill? Your place or mine? Marseilles or Aix? Or as long ago as that Thursday evening When you and I climbed through the bay window On the ground floor of Aquinas Hall And into the room where MacNeice wrote 'Snow', Or the room where they say he wrote 'Snow'. The names teasingly evoke Ulster's British connection (Fitzroy, Notting Hill - a district of London as well as a location in Belfast), foreign entanglements (the Marseillaise?), and religious oppositions (Cromwell/Aquinas). The cream of the joke is that Aquinas Hall, now a hostel for women students, was the palace of Anglican bishops of Down, Connor and Dromore when MacNeice's father held that position. Thus Muldoon smuggles in some factual and transgressive local history. 'History' and 'In Carrowdore Churchyard\u2019 share two MacNeicean premises - or imply therr as a priori: premises which evolved from his reaction against the 'choked mud' of Ireland. Firstly, poetry must lay itself open to a flux of consciousness and history. Secondly, by doing so it can arrive at unpredicted patterns. But Mahon and Muldoon process and develop thej;> premises differently. Flux in 'History' belongs more exclusively to consciousness than do Mahon's partly external 'rough winds' (akin to 'that wind/ Ih&Jz Memory of Major Robert Grego\u2019ry'). Again, where Mahon stresses image and formal clarification, Muldoon stresses language and the riddles of cognition. Yet, Muldoon's irony points to the writing of 'Snow' as the only sure thing amid the cognitive instability. Poetry, then, puts history in its place and thus \n￼- 9- solves once again - if at a further remove from MacNeice's origianl inrush of snow and r~?tls. However, the intensity of their afterglow does not diminish. Muldoon invokes 'Snow' less as written text than through the mystery of its writing. Their rewritings of 'Snow' show Mahon as more preoccupied with poetry's 'formalising activity', and Muldoon with its cognitive activity: with knowing and saying rather than with shape and image. This suggests that both preoccupations and their tension - intrinsic to the tension between Romantic aesthetics and Modernism - are manifested in MacNeice's poetry, not only in the quintessential 'Snow'. As anthologists of Irish poetry Mahon and Muldoon agree on MacNeice's importance, but weight it differently. Mahon's Sphere Book of Modern Irish poetrv (1972) mainly reatures the early MacNeice, Muldoon's Faber Book of Contemporary Irish mainly features the later. These emphases \\ are borne out by their statements elsewhere. For instance, in 1961, when he was writing his own first poems, Mahon reviewed Solstices; the collection in which MacNeice's new kind of -^arable-poem^ became central to his poetry. These parables, putting pressure on idiom and syntax, give MacNeice's metaphysical impulse a linguistic basis it had previously lacked. Mahon commented briskly: 'many of the fifty poems are partly sterile, and when a poet who was once capable of 'Cradle Song' or the more haunting passages of Autumn Journal prjrfers a poem, telling you how to play shove-ha'penny, you begin to suspect he is only writing out of habit'. 'Shove Ha'penny', one of a sequence called 'Indoor Sports', may not be an epic; but its angled syntax and phrasing set up a suggestive emblem of sexual relations: One disc can knock another into place With skill and join here there. No, not like that, Like this. \n￼- 10- The effect is certainly more prcto-Muldoon than p«Pr;to-Mahon. Mahon, to employ MacNeice's own metaphors for his own style, warm1, to its 'bloomand frill and floating image', rather than its later 'syntax A and bony feature'. In Mahon's early poetry we can detect :<c.. to MacNeice's 'bloom and frill', as much as to his absorption of the 'industrialised, commercialised' tracts that MacNeice saw Y\u2019eats (and even Eliot) as excluding. It might not be too much to say that Irish poetry acquired a new horizon when inacNeice wrote in 'Carrickfergus' (1937): 'The brook ran yellow from the factory stinking of chlorine'. Here mythic pastoral meets the 'filthy modern tide', as it does in Mahon's imagination, which also enters Irish poetry from a point north of Belfast (see 'Glengormley'). 'In Carrowdore Churchyard1 encapsulates the MacNeicean tension between the natural and the urban-industrial-historical. But it does so by further concentrating the procedure whereby urban data in early MacNeice becomes image rather than reportage. In late MacNeice such data - e.g. traffic - acquire a parabolic significance distributed through a poem. Mahon, rather, compresses image into symbol: The 'bombed-out town' and bringing 'the all-clear to the empty holes of spring' not only represent poetry as a therapeutic process, but distil the processes of MacNeice's poetry. This accords, too, with Mahon's revival of the Yeatsian and aesthetic theme of art, significantly absent from MacNeice's corpus. However art, poetry as form, has been humbled by its exposure to historical inrush, and MacNeice's dramatisation of that exposure in the mid twentieth century. Obviously distinctive psychological and sociological factors also condition Mahon's poetry. But he has learned from MacNeice that traditional froms must take the imprint of flux. This deeply assimialated knowledge stood Mahon in good stead when, after 1968, he wrote poems such as 'Rage for Order' and 'The Snow Party', poems which involve an ironic collision between Romantic aesthetics (Idea of Order at Key West', 'Lapis Lazuli') \n￼- 11- and the Ulster troubles - a new version of 'the bombed-out town': Somewhere beyond the scorched gable end and the burnt-out buses there is a poet indulging his wretched rage for order Or not as the case may be ... Additional literary influences reinforce Mahon's attraction to the symbolic impart of 'the snow and the huge roses', Muldoon's attraction to the linguistic imprv I of what might be between them. For instance, Robert Graves as well as Yeats steered Mahon towards stanzaic shape (nothing as boggy as 'Birmingham'), Robert Frost steered Muldoon towards the insight that 'all the fun's in how you say a thing'. It was, indeed, with reference to Frost that MacNeice compared syntax in poetry to squash rather than tennis, saluting Frost as 'a master of angles'. Idioms and cliches can also rebound at unexpected angles in poetry ('No, not like that ...'). Whereas Mahon developed MacNeice\u2019s earlier way with the revitalised cliche, which partly involves sheer punning delight in the act of revitalisation ('Which suits you down to the ground\u2019), Muldoon's practice resembles MacNeice's later interrogation of cliches deep structures ('Your place or mine?'). This may occur locally or govern a whole poem. MacNeice's 'The Slow Starter' takes apart 'A watched clock never moves' and reassembles it in a disturbing new stage.. Muldoon's nA~~0 subjects 'Making a rod to beat your own back' to similar treatment. As 'History' indicates, Muldoon's poetry consistently presents language as a shaking surface, to be decoded, recoded and then decoded again. It resists and doubts 'statement'. Nevertheless, the room where MacNeice wrote 'Snow' exists somewhere as a stabilising force, perhaps adjacent to Frost's definition of writing poetry as a momentary 'stay against confusion'. But besides responding to a technical aspect of MacNeice's work, Muldoon also exploits the fact of MacNeice. Here the metaphysics and \n￼<l5 the year when MacNeice's book on Yeats was published. MacNeice and Higgins clash over what constitutes poetry in general and 'Irish poetry' in particular. Higgins, with mistakely psittacist loyality to Yeats, maintains that pure poetry comes from Ireland' and from Irish 'blood-music'. MacNeice, refusing to be 'side-tracked into an Ireland versus England match', defines the poet as 'a sensitive instrument designed to record anything which interests his mind or affects his emotions'. It is unwise to read any Muldoon-manipulated dialogue as coming down completely on one side, but he evidently appoints MacNeice as spokesman for his own creative eclecticism. F.R. Higgins may be a parodic smack at Seamus Heaney. (Heaney spoke up for the Higgins side of the dialogue at the International Writers' Conference, Dublin, June 1988). The highly eclectic \u20197, Middagh Street' might be read as a brilliantly concentrated critical essay. In this, in its literary subject, in a certain amount of cultural-reference rock-jumping, and in a still more {^ nt>CI deployment of sonnet-form, Muldoon leans out to the Modernist wing. (Mahon's - 12- and politics associated with the technique become important. Muldoon uses MacNeice in the same spirit as they both use cliche: as a stalking- horse, as a mask for subversion, as a mask for himself. And it is through MacNeice that Muldoon obliquely comments on the current state of poetry, in Ireland and elsewhere. He does so, firstly, in his epigraph to the Faber Book of Contemporary Irish Poetry; secondly, in the long poem '7, Middagh Street\u2019 (Meeting the British, 1987). Both epigraph and poem suggest that Muldoon is evaluating the present with reference to the earlier history of twentieth-century poetry. Offered in lieu of a first-person introduction, to the anthology, the epigraph is a kind of found eclogue: an excerpt from a s dialogue between MacNeice and F.R. Higgins. This dialogue took place in 1941, \\ \n￼- 13- Modernist are channelled through Beckett.) At the same time, the poems' antithetical gyre comprises rootedness with regard to place, tradition, communal responsibilities, art. As Muldoon imaginatively leave > Ireland, following the Modernist \" ' of exile, he gets a fix on his own situation through the literary-historical moment when Auden, MacNeice, Salvador Dali and other writers and artists bizarrely passed through a New York boarding-house. The year was 1940\u201e \u20197, Middagh Street1 consists of inter-related monologues of which the framing monologues are spoken by Auden and MacNeice. In contrast with the Faber Book, MacNeice now personifies roots. Unlike Auden, he went back to London, the Blitz ('bombed- out town') and the war. (He told his father that he didn't want to 'miss history'.) Auden in '7, Middagh Street' declares, contrastinlgy: 'The roots by which we once were bound//Are severed here'. In writing the poem, Muldoon probably drew on Humphrey Carpenter's biography of Auden which quotes him as 'trying deliberately to live without roots in America', and also cites Edmund Wilson's opinion that America was enabling Auden to become an international poet who took in 'the whole modern world'. At the other end of '7, Middagh Street', however, MacNeice finds himself transported, via the 'dream logic' he and Muldoon share, back to Belfast and its sectarian politics: After drinking all night in a Sands Street shebeen where a sailor played a melodeon made from amerman's spine I left by the back door of Muldoon's (it might have been the Rotterdam) on a Monday morning, falling in with the thousands of shipyardmen who tramped 'towards the front gates of harland and Wolff. The one-eyed foreman had strayed out of Homer: 'MacNeice? That's a Fenian name.' As if to say, 'None of your sort, none of you will as much as go for a rubber hammer never mind chalk a rivet, never mind caulk a seam on the quinquerme of Nineveh.' \n￼XL C In counterpointing Auden's emigration with MacNeice's return (and conflating contemporary Belfast with /Blitzed London) Muldoon keeps his own personal and artistic options open^ the poles of home and abroad in a magnetic relation. He might imply that a Modernist cosmopolitan freedom is not so easily achieved. Or that it is too easily achieved. Here Muldoon reproduces MacNeice's own weighing of Yeats against Eliot. As for the question of 'missing history', Auden having been more political than MacNeice had ceased to be political at all. MacNeice queried the abruptness of the switch, significantly with reference to Auden's view of Yeats in 1939-40. In '7, Middagh Street' Muldoon has Auden say: If Yeats had saved his pencil lead Would certain men have stayed in bed? For history's a twisted root With art its small translucent fruit And never the other way round. This has sometimes been quoted as Muldoon's last word. But in fact he gives the last word to MacNeice who begins with 'In dreams begin responsibilities' and goes on to contradict Auden: 'For poetry can make things happen - / not only can but must.' But it may not be quite accurate to say that '7, Middagh Street' has a last word. Its form is that of a corona - i.e. each monologue takes off from the concluding word or phrase of its predecessor. So the poem has its tail in its mouth. Manefield's symbolising poetry, circles for ever in a characteristic Muldonian imm :am or mystery- voyage. Or the design might be termed a pair oi gyres. But it is certainly not a fJaterian closed circle. Nor does it endorse the dualism of 'twisted' history and \u2018translucent\u2019 art. As the arguments of '7, Middagh Street' rotate on the axis provided by Auden and MacNeice, its imitates the ceaseless engagement between flux and pattern. And it is significant that (as for Mahon in a different - 14- ￼\n￼way) Yeats remains in view behind MacNeice. Despite appearances the poem is neither ludically post-modernist nor eclectically impotent. This suggest how the devolution of Romanticism and traditionalism through Yeats and Ireland still counts in contemporary poetry. Since I wrote the above I have read Ciaran Carson's poem 'Snow' (in Belfast Confetti, 1989) which begins: A white dot flicked back and forth across the bay-window: not A table-tennis ball, but 'ping-pong', since this is happening in another era ... This poem imagines\"^the room where MacNeice wrote 'Snow1, together with all the historical lumber which has since accumulated there-including a bank-clerk whose 'face was snow and roses just behind/The bullet-proof glass'. The poem ends with the speaker delving in 'this Thirties scuffed leather sofa I wanted to make a bid for: I won't say what I paid for it: anything's too much when you have nothing. But in the dark recesses underneath the cushions I found myself kneeling As decades of the Rosary dragged by, the slack of years ago hauled up Bead by bead; and with them, all the haberdashery of loss- cuff buttons, Broken ball-point pens and fluff, old pennies, pins and needles, and yes, A ping-pong ball. I cupped it in my hands like a crystal, seeing not The future, but a shadowed parlour just before th^ blinds are drawn. Someone Has put up two trestles. Handshakes all round, nods and whispers. Roses are brought in, and suddenly, white confetti seethes against the window. The title of the book, Belfast Confetti, signifies bullets. Thomas Flanagan once suggested that much of subsequent Irish poetry in English rests on the 'hard deal board' in Samuel Ferguson's translation of The same might be said of 'There is more than glass between the snow and the huge roses'.
