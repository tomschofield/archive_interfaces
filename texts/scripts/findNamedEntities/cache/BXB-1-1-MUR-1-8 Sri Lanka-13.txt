I acknow  ledge this debt with gratitude. Sigiri Graffiti by S. Paranavitana was published in two volumes by the Oxford University Press for the Government of Ceylon in 1956, and reprinted at the Government Press in Colombo for the Government of Sri Lanka in 1983. The phjtographs of the Sigiriva frescoes were taken by Nihal fernando for this book. I thank him for his gift. I am grateful to several writers who helped me to work on these poems in Sri Lanka. Ashley Halpe, Professor of English at Peradeniya University, introduced me to the Sigiri Graffiti, showed me some of his own versions, and encouraged me to persevere. Anuradha Seneviratn^, Professor of Sinhala at Peradeniya, gave me instruction on the Old Sxnhala texts, including their background, and critical advice on my adaptations. Senake Bandaranaike, Professor of Archaeology at Kelaniya University and Director of the Sigiriya Project, provided me with much information and special access to the Mirror Wall and the Frescoes. An essay by P.B.Meegaskumbera of Peradeniya University influenced my response to several lyrics. [Paragraph of acknowledgement to the editors of the TLS and GRAND STREET for publishing substantial selections of these poems will be included here.] The British High Commissioner to Sri Lanka, David Gladstone, and his wife April, sponsored a performance of these poems, with music by Lalanath de Silva, for two hundred guests at Westminster House, Colombo, vii \n￼on 24 March 1988. I thank them for their hospitality. Finally, a word of thanks to my native country. My work on The Mirror Wail, requiring long visits to Sri Lanka, was continuously and generously supported by Aosdana, the Arts Council and the Department of Foreign Affairs in the Republic of Ireland. \n￼Contents [The numbers in square brackets refer to the Old Sinhala songs in Sigiri Graffiti by S.

After a gap of fifty years, I returned to Sri Lanka, and found the inspiration for these poems. It came from songs written in Old Sinhala during the 8th., 9th. and 10th. centuries. The original holographs remain on the curving, parapet wall of a footpath half way up the rock fortress of Sigiriya in the central province. The wall is about a hundred metres long, and over two metres high. Incised with metal styles in the polished plaster, the songs relate to mysterious, 'golden'\u2019 women in frescoes painted on the undulating rock above this \"mirror wall \u2019, who seem to be dancing in the clouds. Twenty of these portraits have survived since the end of the 5th. century. \"Sigiriya\", or \"Sihigiri\" n Old Sinhala, means \"Lion Rock\u201d: and the Sinhala people are the \"lion\u201d people, mythically descended from a lion who raped an Indian princess. From some directions, the rock resembles a crouching lion tnat has lost its head: and from others, a massive iingam, the symbol of Shiva. Rising 600 feet above the forest, tanks and paddy fields of the peneplain, it stands on the island\u2019s main water parting, where the rivers that flow east into the Bay of Bengal part from those that flow west into the Indian Ocean. Sigiriya was fortified by a king called Kassapa or Kasyapa, who reigned there from A.D. 477-495, the only king of Lanka to have done so. The Mahawamsa, an ancient Theravada Buddhist chronicle written in Pali, accused Kassapa of slaying his father by having him sealed up in a niche inside a wall: Xlll \n￼and said that he chose Sigiriya \u2019'through fear\u2019\u2019, because the rock \"is difficult of ascent for human beings. He cleared (the land) round about, surrounded it with a wall and built a staircase in the form of a lion. Thence it took its name.... Then he built there a fine palace, worthy to behold, like another Alakamanda and dwelt there like Kuvera\u2019'. Kuvera was the god of wealth in the Hindu pantheon, and Alakarnanda, or Alaka in Sanskrit, was the city he occupied on the mythical Mount Kailasa in the Himalayas. The Sanskrit poet Kalidasa, who lived a century before Kassapa, alludes to Kailasa as \"the mirror for goddesses\", and to Alaka as adorned with paintings he compares to the cloud's rainbow. Four of the Sinhaia songs refer to the women in the frescoes as asaran, from apsaras in Sanskrit, the cloud nymphs who frequented Kailasa. One song suggests they were the king's five hundred wives. Were they ''stuck to the rock\" as offerings to Kuvera or the Lion or the local mountain god? Perhaps their function was to ensure sufficient rainfall to grow rice in this dry zone: rain was sometimes regarded as the semen of the gods. After Kassapa was defeated in battle by his half- brother, Sigiriya was abandoned as a royal residence, but greatly revered as a place of secular pilgrimage. People were drawn there from all over Sri Lanka and southern India for the next seven hundred years. Eventually the ruins were smothered in jungle, until the site was opened up in the last century. Some of the writers signed their names on the wall, declaring their rank, profession and place of residence. They were members of a feudal nobility and its entourage; officials, merchants, clerks and Buddhist monks. Only two of the authors professed to be \"poets\". At least twelve poems were written xiv \n￼by women. Monks had occupied Sigiriya centuries before Kassapa's reign, and remained for centuries thereafter. In some of their puritanical songs, they condemned the fresco nymphs as faithless wives or prostitutes or dancing girls. Theravada Buddhism never encouraged erotic art or sensual passion. The women in the pictures were seen by the writers from various contradictory points of view, but never rearing children. War, famine, plague, or what we might call reality, did not enter into their stylised world. Nor was it necessary to describe what could be seen on the spot. No song implies that Kassapa was a parricide, though several argue about his wives' behaviour after his death. There is no definitive version of why the women are on the rock, or what they are doing, or who they are: and the songs grow from this fertile mystery. Called gi in Sinhala, the lyrics were sung, perhaps with vina, flute and drums, in the gallery under the portraits where they were written. There are poems about love, rejection and the separation of lovers; satires and complaints; joyful, erotic celebrations; and rueful ironies. Much of tie writing is light verse or vers de societe. There is at least one prose inscription, which says: I am Budal, I came in company and saw Sihigiri. Many peopie who saw (Sihigiri) have written verses. I therefore did not write one. The forms of the gi are syllabic: usually 38 to 43 syllables, divided into two lines, each of which contains a \"breath\", or caesura, after 9, 10 or 11 syllables. An English quatrain could match this, but Sinhala verse has no stresses. End rhymes are rare, though internal rhyming, assonance and alliteration frequently occur. Some short Sinhala words can have several meanings that deepen the ambiguity, or the irony of a lyric. xv \n￼A few of my poems are versions that keep close to the syllabic count and meaning of their Old Sinhala sources. But more often 1 use a variety of freer forms to elaborate images and ideas evoked by the sources; to bring in modem voices; to include some description and context; or to combine material from several songs. My sources are among the 685 songs that were transcribed, edited, translated and introduced by Senarat Paranavitana in his Sigiri Graffiti, a two volume masterpiece of Sinhala scholarship, which informed and inspired my work. xvi \n￼xvii \n￼xviii \n￼xix \n￼\n￼XX \n￼Invocation All you feel on the Lion Rock won't come by breathing heavily. Take up a style And let the Rain Girls give you airs to lift songs from the scores that pierce the Mirror Wall. 1 \n￼KASSAPA Perhaps the king, whose name evoked the sun, Riding his elephant, under a pearl umbrella, Through parched rice-fields on the dry zone plain, Had seen this rock aspiring from the earth To penetrate the clouds loafing in heaven: And put five hundred of his virgin brides, Dressed in cascades of jewellery, to make A splash on the summit, and entice the gods To cast their semen on the ground as rain: Then shone here, as the god of wealth, supreme In rice and gems, going about on three legs, Devising arts to give the gods sublime Erections that would last: broad galleries Of golden girls the rock itself embraced Inside a wall whose mirror caught their souls: And sheathed the rock-head in a lion mask To father a strong race, out of whose mouth At festivals he made great fountains pour. > \n￼Falling and falling through feverish jungle with leeches sucking our blood, pythons dangling from creepers over the footpath, leopards in ebony trees looking us in the eyes, and herds of wild elephants trumpeting on our tracks, We found our way exalted by this massive monolith, and began as we climbed to love each other better, leaping into fountain tanks to quench fiery thirst. Our thanks to the Lion who protects Sri Lanka for sparing us one glorious day. 3 \n￼Climbed up the Lion Rock and met the King himself: Bricked alive in the mountain with a lion face of brick. His power house ocour induced feverish sweat. We stepped through his open jaws and came out on top, Where earth\u2019s wheel is joined to the great wheel of heaven A sky palace water tower whose old courses cracked. His rain girl collection filled the rock's driest hollow. 4 \n￼Coming up the mountain track singing a song I never got a word from the golden girls kept here by their lover endlessly apart: so I poked around the Lion Rock and was stunned. Look, my darling, how the people Who chatter to each other Lightening the hard way up Are drawn without a word To a woman whose beauty Irradiates the silence of the rock. 5 \n￼The king's palace rock is delectable - or so I had always heard,, and a picture had formed in my mind. Now on the spot, I think 1 will need more eyes than the stars for my mind not to go completely blank. All over the Lion Rock the king had his women fixed up as water nymphs pretending this was heaven: And hared off to look for salvation as a turtle seeking throughout the ocean for a yoke to fit his neck. 6 \n￼\"I\u2019m dying\u201d, the king thought, a while before having to leave this world. He couldn\u2019t take his wives, all tarted up in rich distemper. \"Hang on\u201d, he jeered at them, \n￼Who got angry, you or your husband, (the same word can mean lord). In a song by Mital, ''slovenly w ritten in script attributable to the ninth century\u201d? Were you happy climbing to the mountain top, or dragged by your hair? \"The writing is blurred by the weathering of the plaster, and scribbles of later visitors\u201d. You lept down, they said. Mital was not sure: you could have been thrown. Did you dance on the terrace that hot blustery day too close to the precipice, While the king, smoking ganja, sat calm as a lotus on a solid rock-crystal divan? 8 (continues) \n￼Mital does not mention, because Vagi verse is too spare, your opulent jewellery: The oval aquamarines above and between your breasts, the ponderous goid ear-rings, And arm lets adorned with cats\u2019 eyes and chrysoberyls which kept you chained; Or the rope of pearls hung round your neck enslavingly. He refers obliquely To a tree calied kolomba, (a bad, or a grieving, mother?), able to survive Teetering on the rcck-edge with roots going far down the cliff clinging to every moist crevice. He leaves you in his, poem branching out and blossoming as you fall to this day. 9 \n￼When spoken to never to speak a word to anyone and to keep to our rock. This irrevocable oath they ail had to take before the king\u2019s death when those forest girls were stuck On the mountain, skin dyed to look golden. Hard luck! It was a royal Old Sinhalese trick, Making a political pun to lock the gold girls up in a vocable meaning word and rock: Letting the public try\u2019 by seductive lyric to break them free of their graphic mental block. \n￼Longing to sing and play music she'd brought the lute up to her shoulder when the king's death struck a chord and being as good as gold didn\u2019t she strike the lute to smithereens. Her loose appearance may give offence, But I'll stand up for her innocence. t When told that her prince was dead She tore off her flowery tiara. The blossom in her hand isn\u2019t beckoning: It happened to fall from her head. 11 \n￼They deck you with iove-makmg flowers arrange your hair to fail in seductive tresses put waterliiies and a sapu bud in your hand Now fair girl you are ready for them to attach you 12 to the dark rock for ever \n￼Some of the figures look painfully deformed: all their lustre has long been dimmed. These were pliant girls who had a good \"ime in their time when somebody was fond of them. 13 ","docTitle":"","docDate":"2014-07-01 09:55:18.348"},"meta":{"contentType":"text/raw","emVer":"7.1.1103.5","langIdVer":"DefaultLangId","processingVer":"CalaisJob01","submissionDate":"2014-07-01 09:55:12.832","submitterCode":"57b17a53-6e34-87b0-20ff-a419896f49c9","signature":"digestalg-1|A40bm1ymfYgQfdz1pXmW6kBqpc4=|dn3cR5i85b8IziTei2CforqzlIB0apfT1uS0Pc8iDM8JNqUk5qkR3w==","language":"English"}},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/acb47182-b5ed-3090-8ef6-56e5407c254f/lid/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http://d.opencalais.com/lid/DefaultLangId/English"},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/17950c72-4754-312d-8a06-bf6d646ba422":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"NaturalFeature","name":"Mount Kailasa","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/NaturalFeature","instances":[{"detection":"[was the city he occupied on the mythical ]Mount Kailasa[ in the Himalayas.
