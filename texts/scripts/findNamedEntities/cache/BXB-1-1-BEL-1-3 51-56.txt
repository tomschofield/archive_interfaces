Give out the clay. Never mind if they get it all over their clothes, All over the desks, all over the floor. \u2018Right! Now I want you to make a headmaster.\u2019 They will solemnly prod into life long-snitched headmaster-dolls. Nothing crude like sticking pins? Well all right, we will stick pins then, but also Shove in chewed bubble-gum to make his eyes. Give him a surplice of toffee-paper and hymn-book leaves. Let bottle-tops stinking ofyesterday\u2019s milk be gathered for his medals. s 51 \n￼Ode to Himself I Go on, good monkey, make your bow, be me. Appear as the polite one, the sensitive Shy one, awkward but helpful, Monkey of wisecracks, monkey who knows the words. This social creature must ignore All his disgraces, all the deplorable monkeys; They antic behind his back as if they were at home: Evil-tempered monkey with weak rage, Envious idle incompetent monkey A spiteful mimic of more handsome apes, Belching wasteful monkey, timid Monkey of tiny dishonesties. Sad monkey, a self-pitying one, Unlucky monkey, monkey who was framed By mean|stFeftt» in the shabby years - Poor wretch of a monkey In the freezing winds of time, Almost a brass monkey. Miniature snarling super-ego monkey Squatting on the shoulder of the gross orang-outang And stinking cynical monkey Planning small satisfactions In face of an abstract nothing - What a nest of nasty negative monkeys! II Safer not postulate a central me To be ambitious about all this This chattering toyshopful of monkey puppets. No puppet-master stoops To curb their messy antics: monkey business M ust be endured If only as talk in the head. 52 \n￼To watch is possible: therefore you must watch. Sit down. Sit still. Eat your damned apple up. The largest virtue is to pay attention, Then watch intendy, watcher in the dark - Watch how a jangling piano-range of strings Dangles a reigning Kong for every minute, Wearing your shirt and tie, your beard, your spectacles, Inflections of your voice and gestures of your hands, Grimaces and grimaces and grimaces. Old monkeys never die, fight back and never die. They might fade away if you watch them. And some already folding up their strings Will lie down neatly in a cardboard box. R.I.P. monkey. Then again, R.I.P. monkey. New beasts keep crowding in the wings. Herejeemes, the vulgarest clowns, red-cheeked baboons With their pea+nuts and bananas. Out-stare them. Staunchly watch. Ill The legends say the monkeys drift to sleep Under clear scrutiny of evening sky, Puff into cloud-shapes, fade away And branches prick, impressive silhouette, Pattern of monkey-puzzle tree. \n￼Reasons for Refusal Busy old lady, charitable tray O f social emblems: poppies, people\u2019s blood - I must refuse, make you flush pink Perplexed by abrupt No-thank-you. Yearly I keep up this small priggishness, Would wince worse if I wore one. Make me feel better, fetch a white feather, do. Everyone has list of dead in war, Regrets most of them, e.g. Uncle Cyril; small boy in lace and velvet With pushing sisters muscling all around him, And lofty brothers, whiskers and stiff collars; The youngest was the one who copped it. My mother showed him to me, Neat letters high up on the cenotaph That wedding-caked it up above the park, And shadowed birds on Isaac Watts\u2019white shoulders. And father\u2019s friends, like Sandy Vincent; Brushed sandy hair, moustache, and staring eyes. Kitchener claimed him, but the Southern Railway Held back my father, made him guilty. I hated the khaki photograph, It left a patch on the wallpaper after I took it down. Others I knew stick in the mind, And Tony Lister often - Eyes like holes in foolscap, suffered from piles, Day after day went sick with constipation Until they told him he could drive a truck - Blown up with Second Troop in Greece: We sang all night once when we were on guard. And Ken Gee, our lance-corporal, Christian Scientist - Everyone liked him, knew that he was good \u2014 Had leg and arm blown off, then died. Not all were good. Gross Corporal Rowlandson 54 \n￼Fell in the canal, the corrupt Sweet-water, . And rolled there like a log, drunk and drowned. And I\u2019ve always been glad of the death of Dick Benja A foxy urgent dainty ball-room dancer - Found a new role in military necessity As R.S.M. He waltzed out on parade To make himself hated. Really hated, not an act. He was a proper little porcelain sergeant-major - The earliest bomb made smithereens: Coincidence only, several have assured me. In the school hall was pretty glass Where prissy light shone through St George - The highest holiest manhood, he! And underneath were slain Old Boys In tasteful lettering on whited slab - And, each November, Ferdy the Headmaster Reared himself squat and rolled his eyeballs upward, Rolled the whole roll-call off an oily tongue, Remorselessly from A to Z. Of all the squirmers, Roger Frampton\u2019s lips Most elegantly curled, showed most disgust. He was a pattern of accomplishments, And joined the Party first, and left it first, At OCTU won a prize belt, most improbable, Was desert-killed in \u201940, much too soon. His name should burn right through monument. No poppy, thank you. \n￼Dreams of Evasion I Deeper and deeper into softer moss Like rolling downs, but swamp, electric-green Velvetest counterpane but deeper in Reeds pricking, sinuous knitting-needles, bunched Further and deeper in to buzzing confusion Where flowersjc ttbrurnished insects Tufted sods sink, bristle, go soft Stamp if you like, tread something flat Shod feet will cut sharp shapes, but now Footprints are Filling vaguely with Seeping, spread to shapes of bruises Sucking is always starting under your II Water haze dazzles, spits on face Flickering adders, threads of streams Stitch, stitch, a brilliance, nets of spiteful talk Incessant glitter and chatter, theft of soil Zips gripping, streams bite, bite their way Urgent to the river. There it lolls A glint, through greasy banks. And nudges It has eaten its contours into smiling curves III Must get away, must not get wet or dirty Always a way out, always a bridge Round the next bend, before the silver sewage Dimples to whirlpools, piles to a weir Be clever, Find the fussy steps to reach a Safe structure strutting, riveted in air ","docTitle":"","docDate":"2014-07-01 08:44:59.830"},"meta":{"contentType":"text/raw","emVer":"7.1.1103.5","langIdVer":"DefaultLangId","processingVer":"CalaisJob01","submissionDate":"2014-07-01 08:44:58.145","submitterCode":"57b17a53-6e34-87b0-20ff-a419896f49c9","signature":"digestalg-1|+om0v5g0P+zM2FRI+uvXX9B2uMs=|f9j2LYEDX+FWpc91G2tMIFcvUzKNxM6SQXH9V3SS9Zd2L5x+9oBY1w==","language":"English"}},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/2dddd3b5-9d20-394f-9f4c-e1d5d9afc631/lid/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http://d.opencalais.com/lid/DefaultLangId/English"},"http://d.opencalais.com/pershash-1/d8fe643f-c2fd-3346-a3dc-38851b038f6c":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"Person","name":"Rowlandson","persontype":"military","nationality":"N/A","commonname":"Rowlandson","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/Person","instances":[{"detection":"[then died.
