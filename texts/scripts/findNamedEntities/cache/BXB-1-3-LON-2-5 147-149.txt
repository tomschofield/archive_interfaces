His regionalist projects were undertaken in opposition to the \u2018English colonial\u2019 panic which led Unionism to cling culturally to \u2018the mainland\u2019 and forget its own history in Ireland. In the mani  festo for The Bridge Hubert Butler says: \u2018the province has the artificial vitality of the garrison town and no organic life\u2019. Mean  while, Hewitt was acting on Butler\u2019s concern that \u2018Ulster would be of no value to Ireland if she were robbed of her rich history, her varied traditions\u2019.73 (Butler, MacNeice and Hewitt agree on their dislike of Unionist efforts to become \u2018more English than the English\u2019.) Hewitt was always conscious of Ulster in Ireland, however regional his focus. Nevertheless, he relished his affiliations to certain English traditions, without hatred torturing him with love in Yeatsian or Anglo-Irish style: M y m other tongue is English, instrum ent and tool o f m y thought and expression; John Ball, the Diggers, the Levellers, the Chartists, Paine, Cobbett, M orris, a strong thread in the fabric of my philosophy, I learned about in English history...I also draw upon an English literary tradition which includes M arvell, Crabbe, W ordsworth, Clare...74 Hewitt\u2019s writings betray an Ulster awareness of sectarian differ  ence which contrasts with Butler\u2019s focus on mentalities and Yeats\u2019s refusal to admit directly (in his poetry at least) that he does not speak for the whole of Ireland. Thus when Hewitt is \u2018In the Rosses\u2019 he perceives \u2018the hospitable Irish\u2019 as other; when in the glens of Antrim, although an atheist, he distinguishes his Methodist family tradition from people \u2018of a vainer faith\u2019; and among Cath  olic emigrants to Coventry he sits \u2018in enclave of my nation, but apart\u2019. However, for all his wariness of the Anglo-Irish (which extends to a suspicion of high style) Hewitt must have modelled his Ulster regionalism on the Revival as well as on Scottish or Welsh literary Nationalism (themselves indebted to the Irish example). His cultural entrepreneurship resembles the hyper-activity of the early Yeats\u201d. Also, \u2018Freehold\u2019, his rhapsodic celebration of the region (1946), might be retitled \u2018The Regional Being\u2019 by analogy with AE\u2019s The National Being. Thus Hewitt in the North complements Hubert Butler as a practical visionary, a pragmatic defender of \n￼Longley 130-149 4/5/94 11:21 am Page o- 148 \u2018DEFENDING IRELAND\u2019S SOUL\u2019 Ireland\u2019s soul. And his mystique of Ulsterness also owes something to Protestant Nationalist ideology, even if he left his utopian options open between \u2018a federated British Isles, or a federal Ireland\u2019:76 I know my comer in the universe; my corner, this small region limited in space by sea, in time by my own dead... (\u2018Freehold\u2019) A final word on Wolfe Tone, still the object of mixed literary idealism as well as of competition between Republican parties. Protestant and Catholic Nationalism also converge on Tone but there the misunderstandings begin. The idea that an embryonic non-sectarian Eden or \u2018sweet/equal Republic\u2019 (Tom Paulin) was aborted in 1798 has been upset by research such as Marianne Elliott\u2019s: \u2018to assume that radicalism and anti-catholicism cannot exist within Presbyterianism is to misconceive its true nature. Anti-catholicism is part of that radicalism, and the United Irishmen were less tolerant in religious matters than later nationalist tradition cared to admit.\u2019 7 Or, alternatively, as Hoppen puts it: \u2018The secular Republicanism of Tone, though not entirely destroyed, was to survive largely through the muffled and garbled filter produced by the sectarian concerns of the [Catholic] Defender tradition.\u2019781 have suggested in \u2018Progressive Bookmen\u2019 that the interest of modern Northern Protestant (and indeed Catholic) writers in 1798 itself reflects different. sectarian and political dispositions. Thus I feel that Paulin\u2019s Liberty Tree simplifies history and literary history when he mythologises too sharp a contrast between radical Presbyterianism and contemporary \u2018Desertmartin\u2019, ignoring all intervening Protestant complexities: \u2018I see a culture of twigs and bird-shit/Waving a gaudy flag it loves and curses\u2019. Hewitt, for instance, is much less interested in the Anglo-Irish Tone or the \u2018united\u2019 aspect of the United Irishmen, than in \u2018the stocky figure ofJames Hope\u2019: his \u2018fine, sinewy, balanced prose\u2019, his \u2018stubborn attitude\u2019\u201d (\u2018stubborn\u2019 is Hewitt\u2019s stocky version of Yeats\u2019s \u2018indomitable\u2019) and his status as \u2018the only one of them all to grasp firmly the class complications in the struggle which they had waged\u2019.80 Hubert Butler, constant in his loyalty to Tone, interprets Tone\u2019s Nationalism as \u2018neighbourliness and shared experiences and a common devotion to the land in which you live\u2019.81 As we have seen, such devotion need not term itself \u2018Nationalist\u2019. The Protestant authors I have considered all in some sense unravel the dark encodings of Yeats\u2019s last writings. Their imaginative pos  session of Ireland is hedged, to varying degrees, by awareness that it might be disputed.
