The brutal details of my up  bringing need no embellishment, I reply, they speak for them  selves. Florence commisferated. Almost better not to have known 'em, she said, if that's how parents carry on. Don't make it sound as though tney're all like that, says Lilian, ny father was as good as gold to me. There are exceptions, Mrs v^lack, the Marquis says, there must certainly be excep- tions, j. don't doubt. She recalled our firs-t meeting, and we laughed again at my hoary appearance under the flour. She all  uded with a straight face to my sister in Aberystwyth and hop  ed she would not be put out by my failure to arrive. I'll write to her, I said, I'll set her mind at rest. I wonder, she said, whether your adolescence and early manhood were as unhappy as your earliest years. This is where the lies begin, says Lilian. I replied that it was difficult, perhaps even im  possible, to overcome the handicap of a bad start in life; but that I had done my best; I had tried; nobody could say I hadn't; but I was no saint- who was?- and doing my level best to improve myself 1 had often been beaten down. Had I met with much kind  ness? she wanted to know, a man on the move from place to place was very dependent on acts of kindness, she supposed. She doubt  ed if 1 had ever been married, had I? thought me still unattached; but of course 1 had been in love- who hadn't?- and perhaps my disappointments had embittered me. 1 nodded. You nodded?- the Widow outraged- you never come clean? Lilian this was years ago, most of what I take you to be came after it. Don't give me that, she says, you've been wronging foolish women since you could walk. Oh before that, Mrs Clack. It's said I could in  veigle complete strangers into offering me the tittie. And she never once, says Bowles, this brazen harlot, never once made any mention of the man she was married to, and him away fighting for his king and country? Every two or three weeks there'd be a letter from him. She went and collected ii at the post office when we were in town. The first she was very silent all the way back, 1 guessed why. That evening she was sid  ing the tea things, Mother had left the room. He's got no leave, said Florence, he'll not be home till the autumn. I'm sorry to hear it, 1 said. The summer will be very long, she said. I sudd  enly began asking her questions, one after the other in a rush: was he well? was he in a safe place? was he anxious on her account? 2 \n￼was he much grieved not to be coming home earlier? She blushed and left the room. After that I quite often men  tioned him. When? the Marquis asks, on what occasions? A week or so later, for example, she asked me whether I had ever come close to marrying. I evaded the question and ask- ed whe*ther Jack had ideas for the farm when he returned. And about that time, coming back from town, she had been very silent and 1 noticed that her lips were tremb  ling. Abruptly I asked her whether Jack had always wanted to be a soldier, and when she made no answer 1 began to specu  late aloud. I see, the Marquis says. Yes, I say, now I come to think of it I was forever mentioning jack. Scarecrow, says the Marquis. It's beyond me, says Bowles, how women can act the way they do. Whores of Babylon. You'll not be mean  ing that in a general way, I hope, the Widow says, joe, ask Mr Bowles what his meaning was in that last remark. A train, a deafening train. Joe's mouthing mouth. Bowles shaking his weasely head. Drinks, glances, a shudder of fear in the glasses (for who wants barring? nobody). Go on, Mr Horn. A brick drops off the wall into the yard, Them trains, says the Widow, '11 bring this whole place down one of these days. We're due for some action, Walter says. Go any slower you'll be in reverse. Too halcyon, you mean? The Captain said the fP same. You mean the mumble of thunder to spoj.1 our picnic. It's coming again, says the Marquis. Look Mr 0-6 Mr Horn, I'm a complete ignoramus in these matters but my view is this: there was an almost instantaneous upsurge of passion that first evening when you might, as I think you said, have gone in un  to her, her lying, as you assumed, awake and disposed to yield (Lilian: the trollop). Followed then the period we are still in: one of relief, gratitude for preserved innocence, self- congratulation and suspension. This agreeable interlude is even now drawing to a close. The wave of the first evening, or orte very like it, its big brother perhaps, is rising and app  roaching, it will darken the sun, your floating home will be overwhelmed, mebbe, I say. The Captain said we reminded him of a toy he used to pass the hours with sitting alone among the tea-chests in a lumber room: it was a stepped series of amusing figures, a golliwog, a Chinaman, a moustachioed dago etc, all scalped and slung one above the other on parallel bars, and in  to the empty head of the topman, a Froggie it was, water dripp- Z o4<- \n￼..p / ed until the head was full- whereupon, with a terrifying sud  denness, monsewer tilted forward, pitching the contents of his head into the Chink's, who bowed his lot into the coon's, who threw up his into the xberian gent's, who voided himself etc. Recalling this, the Captain was wide awake again. He gripped my arm. nobby, he said, what fascination I used to feel,^&fee terror.,mounting drop by drop, of the approaching-nrem- o«-t when the Frog, a very cocky blighter as most Frogs are in my experience, suddenly swung and filled the Chinaman. The whole thing was finished in a matter of seconds and all the chaps were rocking quietly on their bars. Now you and Florence, he went on, are filling up daily with drops of amorous passion, and there'll come a moment, and I'm thinking it won't be long, when suddenly you'll find yourselves headfirst and legs in the air. He's deep that man, says Lilian, I've said so before, it's a , So pretty conceit, says the Marquis,/I agreev though what we were to tip our affections into I wasn't sure, xhat's often the way with analogies, says the Marquis, thoy don't want straining w©. best not to strain \u2019tliem too hard. I-'m-He wasn' t suggesting there was a receptacle below you,y/There was an abyss, 1 say. Another thing: I never returned to the vertical once I'd kipp  ed. I'd rather you thought of me as an Orkney fisherman gone overboard and for a moment still addressing an empty sky and an empty ocean but about to plummet to the bottom when his sea- boots fill. Not empty, Mr Horn, says the Marquis, there's al  ways someone listening, it won't be me, says Lilian, not if what I think's coming ijs coming. ^.t was the last day of May, a Friday, apple and Eve day. I was alone in the Dry Field hoeing something warm and young and sprouting, I forget what. It was mid-afternoon and the sun shining. We had driven to market the previous day and she had bought me the little pocket-book aforementioned. I was dwelling on things, my heart beat faster. It was very light work but my heart began beating as though I'd been heaving trees. I was filling up; remembering things, I was nearly ready to sink. Oh, I never asked myself the particular question- all 1 mutt  ered (looking round, seeing that the field was empty^and--&-irte-nt-, was: what's up with me? I couldn't place the sun, the blue sky seemed to be darkening; the silence drummed at my ears, it was quite likely she would visit me, she often sauntered out, $jiG I 05 \n￼That day I didn't know whether I wanted her to enure or not, a>L4 ray feelings broke in confusion around the possibility. She came. It wasn't up to me, all I had to do was stand in the field, it was up to her. When I saw her come through the gap in the hedge my knees went weak, I had to lean on the hoe, my mouth went dry and I heard the crescendo rolling of the drums of panic. She took her time, she sauntered round the hedges picking flowers. I hung on the hoe. She was wear  ing a bright red shawl I hadn't seen before and under it a white blouse open at the neck.q«a^^ke«?swls^,i^r-/S3|}ms^ba,re% She had quite a bouquet when she crossed the field to me. Her face! the lips were almost sullen. First she said nothing and I couldn't get my breath. We looked at the flowers, they were mainly red and white. You getting on alright? she said, I just came out to see. I nodded, I couldn't speak. They've gone visiting, she said, Father fancied a drive. They'll not be back, she said, it'll be dark before they're back, Father'll want a drink. Her voice giving out, her eyes, like mine, on the bunch of wild flowers. They'll not be home, she said, we've got the place to ourselves for a bit, nobody'll come. Never a glance. She turned and crossed the field, stepping along the rows. Never looked round, but went very slowly, head bowed, through the gap in the hedge. Her red shawl, the sleeves of her blouse. f ","docTitle":"","docDate":"2014-07-01 09:48:32.490"},"meta":{"contentType":"text/raw","emVer":"7.1.1103.5","langIdVer":"DefaultLangId","processingVer":"CalaisJob01","submissionDate":"2014-07-01 09:48:30.212","submitterCode":"57b17a53-6e34-87b0-20ff-a419896f49c9","signature":"digestalg-1|bHIR3r28E4izlRphcNaLy9AJ+Jk=|DjEoQh1rlMNNhazOpdpgSqUVjuiQ4EbWCoVEzE6BKIzWsh3URscWvw==","language":"English"}},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/3dba4b7b-f462-3cb2-977f-9f082100bd96/lid/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http://d.opencalais.com/lid/DefaultLangId/English"},"http://d.opencalais.com/pershash-1/3f7ecf87-376e-3884-a010-0c65b2440875":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"Person","name":"Horn","persontype":"N/A","nationality":"N/A","commonname":"Horn","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/Person","instances":[{"detection":"[glasses (for who wants barring? nobody).
