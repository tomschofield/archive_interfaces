And I will make you red , will pierce the sun To give you blood. First the hood forced from your head Then the plunge. And I will turn the snow to hot hot milk Shot from the nipple. And I will kill your life before me, Your origin in the wild wild sea. I will softly close the hole And blow a kiss. Cuckoo I am the cuckoo I grow bigger Uglier On the portions of myself You will allow Or The versions of yourselves You think I am. I am the bird You borrowed from a child. 11 ","docTitle":"","docDate":"1993-03-25"},"meta":{"contentType":"text/raw","emVer":"7.1.1103.5","langIdVer":"DefaultLangId","processingVer":"CalaisJob01","submissionDate":"2014-07-01 09:56:54.973","submitterCode":"57b17a53-6e34-87b0-20ff-a419896f49c9","signature":"digestalg-1|XA4y3AEeGxA9NMI0+pV1Pknppyw=|HZIGo2fRkE/zr7bW1ToNX0/rN0gv4C8lFkU0zvl6Dsc3G5c3fSbfCA==","language":"English"}},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/1e227990-0ade-30b5-90f8-cdd25daafd0b/lid/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http://d.opencalais.com/lid/DefaultLangId/English"},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/b6597b3e-311b-3937-8660-3a585e18d9be":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"Position","name":"correspondent","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/Position","instances":[{"detection":"[ or lovely thing exists in this world without its ]correspondent[ darkness. -e \n￼Randall 9-36 25/3/93 12:30 am]","prefix":" or lovely thing exists in this world without its ","exact":"correspondent","suffix":" darkness. -e \n￼Randall 9-36 25/3/93 12:30 am","offset":1330,"length":13}],"relevance":0.305},"http://d.opencalais.com/pershash-1/05eaa91a-fb20-3274-9877-b1ae3155d195":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"Person","name":"Ophelia Drowning","persontype":"N/A","nationality":"N/A","commonname":"Ophelia Drowning","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/Person","instances":[{"detection":"[Catch as Catch Can 55 His Letter.
