Never before have they been in so much heaven. Never before has everything human made sense. But then they turn away as if nothing had happened, with the slow almost stepless step of someone moving a piano, or balancing an altar on their head - watch them as they wander off among the flowers, with blankets and zafus, apricots and barley, all stowed away between their stumps of horns. I can even imagine^ Aufschnaiter\u2019s Rolex there, that he sold to buy something to eat one night in Tibet. I\u2019ve forgotten to mention the ringlet, single and white, that hangs from each tail like a tendril or Viennese whorl. -0 O 111 \n￼Potato City Her name was Beryl. Like the precious stone. Bald and louche, her job was beating children and stuffing them in cots that didn't fit or stuffing chickens down their hopeless throats. Some of them were more than twice her size so discipline was obviously essential. And discipline in fact was her strong point. Her pigeon-chested chest was rigid with it. Her colleague was a Miss Kartoffel-Salat - a sullen creature Uncle P. produced (judging by the idiotic name.) Bored? Was that it? Bored to tears like me? We should have gone to that Potato City,alluded to in your more garrulous moments, where people with big heads wear hats on spikes they sink into thwir skulls in special rituals involving brewing the resulting discharge. The atmosphere begins to get oppressive, and non-potatoes feel like creeping out. In or out or up or down - who cares? In the thumping subterranean darkness, hot potato breasts, potato knees, potato knuckles and -potato cheeks focus singlemindedly on merry-making. Even in the nurseries lunar babies butt each other with their heads and laugh. \n￼Hill Trembling 95-123 3/2/94 12:28 pm ge 96 Beethoven\u2019s Mother When the glazier manoeuvres his rectangle of glass across the street like a slice of frozen lake, I think of you; when small flocks, roaming open fields in autumn like freed cyclamen, on wings as thin as nasal blood-vessels, sing as they fly, I think of you; and when I read that Beethoven\u2019s mother, cooking pastries in the back streets of Cologne, \u2018lulls his overwrought feelings into tranquijity\u2019, of course I think I\u2019m Beethoven, with you. -- ","docTitle":"","docDate":"1994-03-02"},"meta":{"contentType":"text/raw","emVer":"7.1.1103.5","langIdVer":"DefaultLangId","processingVer":"CalaisJob01","submissionDate":"2014-07-01 09:53:51.230","submitterCode":"57b17a53-6e34-87b0-20ff-a419896f49c9","signature":"digestalg-1|GoHPmxmNYlLmr3HhlzCzyK4p24o=|RaLFggL+mGr07seOzI0J/u6HROlcCeemyK9vMmORBbr6IpZIiDVMVA==","language":"English"}},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/468700a8-d55d-3e5a-b72c-81f8e0381a56/cat/1":{"_typeGroup":"topics","category":"http://d.opencalais.com/cat/Calais/Hospitality_Recreation","classifierName":"Calais","categoryName":"Hospitality_Recreation","score":0.581},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/468700a8-d55d-3e5a-b72c-81f8e0381a56/cat/2":{"_typeGroup":"topics","category":"http://d.opencalais.com/cat/Calais/HumanInterest","classifierName":"Calais","categoryName":"Human Interest","score":0.556},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/468700a8-d55d-3e5a-b72c-81f8e0381a56/lid/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http://d.opencalais.com/lid/DefaultLangId/English"},"http://d.opencalais.com/pershash-1/9c64b8db-9b98-3806-8bf8-aa97f63903b3":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"Person","name":"Beethoven","persontype":"N/A","nationality":"N/A","commonname":"Beethoven","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/Person","instances":[{"detection":"[\n￼Hill Trembling 95-123 3/2/94 12:28 pm ge 96 ]Beethoven[\u2019s Mother When the glazier manoeuvres his]","prefix":"\n￼Hill Trembling 95-123 3/2/94 12:28 pm ge 96 ","exact":"Beethoven","suffix":"\u2019s Mother When the glazier manoeuvres his","offset":3139,"length":9},{"detection":"[Beethoven\u2019s Mother When the glazier manoeuvres ]his[ rectangle of glass across the street like a]","prefix":"Beethoven\u2019s Mother When the glazier manoeuvres ","exact":"his","suffix":" rectangle of glass across the street like a","offset":3186,"length":3},{"detection":"[they fly, I think of you; and when I read that ]Beethoven[\u2019s mother, cooking pastries in the back streets]","prefix":"they fly, I think of you; and when I read that ","exact":"Beethoven","suffix":"\u2019s mother, cooking pastries in the back streets","offset":3438,"length":9},{"detection":"[pastries in the back streets of Cologne, \u2018lulls ]his[ overwrought feelings into tranquijity\u2019, of]","prefix":"pastries in the back streets of Cologne, \u2018lulls ","exact":"his","suffix":" overwrought feelings into tranquijity\u2019, of","offset":3514,"length":3},{"detection":"[into tranquijity\u2019, of course I think I\u2019m ]Beethoven[, with you. -- ]","prefix":"into tranquijity\u2019, of course I think I\u2019m ","exact":"Beethoven","suffix":", with you. -- ","offset":3580,"length":9}],"relevance":0.223},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/cde74663-c1be-389c-9f60-76b321021e61":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"IndustryTerm","name":"e- ￼","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/IndustryTerm","instances":[{"detection":"[asleep like a pear behind closed doors. 118 -]e- \n￼[Hill Trembling 95-123 3/2/94 12:30 pm Wge 111]","prefix":"asleep like a pear behind closed doors. 118 -","exact":"e- \n￼","suffix":"Hill Trembling 95-123 3/2/94 12:30 pm Wge 111","offset":564,"length":5}],"relevance":0.335},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/e3510118-363f-3c80-a4f5-c44619340b7a":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"City","name":"Cologne","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/City","instances":[{"detection":"[mother, cooking pastries in the back streets of ]Cologne[, \u2018lulls his overwrought feelings into]","prefix":"mother, cooking pastries in the back streets of ","exact":"Cologne","suffix":", \u2018lulls his overwrought feelings into","offset":3498,"length":7}],"relevance":0.092,"resolutions":[{"id":"http://d.opencalais.com/er/geo/city/ralg-geo1/17640531-568b-59cf-54cf-f4db0f111ff3","name":"Cologne,North Rhine-Westphalia,Germany","shortname":"Cologne","containedbystate":"North Rhine-Westphalia","containedbycountry":"Germany","latitude":"50.942421","longitude":"7.02919"}]},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/7fa5cd67-87cb-3ac3-8eea-52049b2b17df":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"Country","name":"Tibet","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/Country","instances":[{"detection":"[he sold to buy something to eat one night in ]Tibet[.
