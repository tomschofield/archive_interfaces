University of Guelph. And guess how I pronounce it? I just can\u2019t help myself. The students are all eating - yes, it\u2019s a real mean trick. But it seepis that, when this town was named, Someone Svas beftjg sick! I am playing at a plush, antiseptic businessman\u2019s dinner and danceestablishment called the Norwood Hotel; it\u2019s my first gig in Winnfpeg,and it seems completely self-evident that nofone round here has thd^aintest idea what Attila the Stockbroker is. The gig has beehjprganised at very short notice by the Winnipeg Folk Festival; as far asl can tell, the publicity consists of a box ad in the hotel restaurant^nenu and a couple of leaflets shoved between the Greatful Dead albumsin the local second-hand record store. There is a two-dollar admissionjcharge, waived for anyone staying at or entertaining in the hotel. The majority of the audience consists of businessmen; corporate^nales, each with one of those little cardboard identification badges which middle-aged executives wear in lieu of personalities when they gc^to business functions in hotels. They are all rather drunk, and^bviously under the impression that Attila the Stockbroker is some kinc^of country and western act. There\u2019s a smattering of Folk Club regulars, mostly Woodstockkurvivors and Aran sweater victims, and, to my pleasure arid surprise, agroup of ten or so who look like punks and show every sign or interesj£5n fact virtually all of them come up to me individually during thecourse of the evening and ask me why the hell Pm playing at a countryand western club instead of the local anarcho-veggie commune, and willl come and play for them there after I\u2019ve been booed off? At the appointed hour I take the stage. Directly in front of me]and seemingly oblivious of my presence, four gentleman of the 38 \n￼Attila 28-47 3/9/92 12:39 am Page 39 wristjtalk corporate gunk - their lapel badges indicating an umbilicafallegiance to a local computer firm.

There are wallabies and wombats, there are possums, bit lizards and kangaroos of all sorts, yes, even a big red and all these different species have one quality in common yes, each of them is wonderfully, spectacularly dead.r^.
