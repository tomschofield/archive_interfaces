Prehensile toes Can pick up any pin Off a floor and pinch like tweezers. The heel will always show its real age. The arch in the foot Of a ballerina Is a miniature Champs Elysees. Each arthritic bone has something to say. You may not like it Since what you hear may have Something to do with having had yours Beaten for what you wrote, said or did. Or worse for doing Nothing at all when what Was required of you was grace, Not turned-in or flat or calloused feet. \n￼- 14 - PULSE If I were a frozen lake, then the strumming would be loudest where the ice is thinnest and reveals what is most precious in that lake. A child is one thin sheet of ice with a faint pulse that can be located anywhere. As that child surfaces from sleep, or speeds/cross a room, or does something unexpected suddenly, the pulse trapped in the neck, just below the skin, unseen and unheard till now, flutters audibly. First it fades, like a voice under that ice, or an astonished face sliding from the thin, translucent surface that gave way to the body. When the noise finally ceases it\u2019s the pulse retreated, retired to a part of the lake with ice that\u2019s thick, obfuscated and lost. The prayer is for ice on a lake to keep, for the staggering pulse to remain, for ice to look its glassiest, most translucent and inviting always. \n￼- XV - KNEES Knobbly and bony, they are maracas; broad and flat, landing pads for helicopters; in hot weather, pans for frying eggs; knees are often the only blemish on legs. Without them we\u2019d star in The Wizard of Oz as the Tin Man, or a zombie in rigormortis. They crack and creak in someone else\u2019s home, drawing stupid comments and flowering shame. If kept together they\u2019re an effective contraceptive: \"knees-up Mother Brown\" doesn\u2019t mean she has nice knees. They warn of cold spells, old age, flu; rub them down, oil them and they shine like new. Some people lose theirs for a debt; others wish they could lose the ones they\u2019ve got. A frightened knee sounds like a woodpecker. A brave knee feels the way a frightened knee sounds. They are proud, strong men, two thirds high, bent at a coal face with miles of earth for sky; points of supplication; chivalrous courtship; bashers of groins; beggars for mercy; floor polishers; crawlers. Cathedral domes; twin vaults; skulls over delicate brains; bull-strong and bull-crazy; obedient and unquestioning; miracle carriers, I worship at your steps; knees, how can I serve you as you have served me? \n￼- xvi - THIRTEEN VIEWS OF A PENIS -1- A Buddist demonstration of faith: how much drinking water (uncarbonated) can a monk draw up his untumid penis. -2- In an apartment on Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side a woman\u2019s voice cries, \"For God\u2019s sake, don\u2019t come!\" -3- At a public congressional hearing the prospective supreme court judge has a boast about the size of his recounted. -4- In a house in East London in 1973 or 4, five brothers ages six to sixteen are circumcised on a table in a back room, consecutively. -5- The caption for a snap of a man whose penis is wrapped right around one thigh reads, \"He yanked it everyday for this.\" -6- All mothers in a certain tribe pop into their mouths the penis of crying babies to soothe them. -7- Needless to say it works everytime, unless there is something seriously wrong with the boy. \n￼-8- A man who reached the North Pole desperately wanted to pee, despite a furious search he couldn\u2019t find his. -9- Flaccid, boneless, chesspiece (a bishop), suspended upsidedown like a bat in a dark cave. - 10- Capable of growing up to thrice its resting size, when stimulated by touch or thought or praise. - 11- A blueprint for most weapons of destruction: missiles, guns spears and sex without condoms. - 12- In old age, when all else fails, it may be the last thing left to remind the old man of younger days. - 13 - We are living in the decline of the Penis Age. You can tell at a public urinal: a penis is always either too small or too large. \n￼THE BODY IN QUESTION - 1 - EYEBROWS that meet and merge bridge the left side and right side of the brain. Bushy ones, thick ones, are like hats pulled low over the eyes. They\u2019re not sexy though the bearer of bushy eyebrows is often highly sexed, and must pluck them to study and pass exams. Shave one or both entirely and your face becomes a big forehead; an assault zone, inviting slaps and jokes, that shines with anxiety. People who talk with their eyebrows have an extra dictionary; we\u2019d be foolish to raise our own and not join them; especially since they may become Prime Minister one day. \n￼- 2 - EYES They lie. They don\u2019t mean to. They twinkle. You can\u2019t stop them. They water themselves, but only grow tired. They are most honest with their lids down. They beg to be robbed of sleep. They die on us long before the heart stops (when it decides it can\u2019t afford to love). They die by losing their shine, by hiding their whites. Somehow they are able to watch themselves knowing full well they are quite dead. \n￼- 3 - NOSTRILS He cuts-back the hairs poking out two moist tunnels sneezing at the microscopic dust off his Byron not opened since 1979 the year sweet Minnie Rippfeton died and he sneezed volleys as he cried in his stupid search of Don Juan for a fitting line, just one. \n￼- 4 - LIPS Thermometers for love, lust and everything above or below them. Hold an ice cube to the lips; watch the whole body react; see it harvest a goosepimple crop long before the lips change from red to purple or if dark already, darker still, shrivelling to dried prunes as the blood lips find so fattening is driven out. Don\u2019t the toes and fingers curl, arch, stretch, shake, hypotherm? Isn\u2019t the effect on the scrotum or labia exactly that of Joyce\u2019s sea? r \n￼- 5 - CLAVICLE If water gathers there, then it must be because you are caught in a downpour. If tears reach that far, then your grief is major, although you may not know it. If your lover can\u2019t help showering there' with kisses, the blessing of such attention will turn sour. Test it. Try No, in your haughtiest Napoleonic grandeur. A perfect clavicle is a curse in disguise- is grief birthmarked- made flesh and bone. / \n￼- 6 - NIPPLES Safety pins or rings through them are acts of self-abuse; perfectly reasonable in a democracy and perfectly vulgar. If Jesus upset the moneymakers in the house of God, his fathers house, by pedalling faith, at least his were the goods of the soul. When nipples are attentive to the tongue, when they harden in concentration, they take on aspects of the mind; they relocate consciousness from the head to the chest; they argue on our behalf that faith has at least two sides none of which can be pinned down.
