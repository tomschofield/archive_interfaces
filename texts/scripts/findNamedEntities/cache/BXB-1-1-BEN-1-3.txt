Someone has fed in more bad news than good, And the messages tick out mad irrelevancies and ironies. Those putting in a modest request for comedy Get tragedy, tout court: And those banking on a touch of gravitas Get the pratfall and the cauliflower ear. It\u2019s no use fighting the system. Keep a low profile, I say, And if the messages come tapping out too black, You can always go to earth. Threat The seagulls are plunging past the window. With vixen cries they rake the ground for victims, Ready to put the beak in. They have not spotted me yet, here in bed, And, with my dark coverlet and sparse hair, I am inconspicuous. They would like to see my face come through the door (Disc-like, attracting harm); But want must be their master. My garden is their arena. They are lining the trees. My intellect is well known to them And they itch to pick my brains. 34 \n￼Time Slip When she left him, time would not move on. It hung around him, stale as city air, Inert, refusing to get the day over. Chores, reflections, ruses, rituals, All failed to budge this trick of time. He shook the clock and studied the sun. The day had fallen into a fault, And there he turned, suspended, At odds: beating at the vacuum, Shouting for a hand to pull him back Into chronology. Travelling Light This whiskery old dog shed its gaze over me, W orshipping with brown and clouded eyes, Thinking I was God knows what: Saviour, provider, Second Comer, dog\u2019s delight.\" He was putting on the limping walk, Currying not only favour But commitment, love, warmth \u2014 Who knows what package of trouble? Soliciting, and too old for it. I pulled back, called a halt to the affair, Turned off round a corner, put space behind me. I like to travel light; And yet all day I felt trainelled: Something grated, and Distracted me Like a broken fingernail. \n￼Deadlines Sullen, they lie in their tissue paper refusing to speak or to move their limbs. If they know the plot, they do not like it. The ardent hero has lost his voice: the incestuous father has forgotten his vice and the heroine is in her depressive phase. What can I do? One of them labours into a sitting position. He cranks open his mouth and speaks. Do you come heir often? he grins. \u2018It\u2019s the Position That Counts\u2019 I only have to walk down the street past the betting shop with its rainbow door strips and the barber\u2019s window furnished with dusty Durex; I only have to cross the road under the railway, where the shit-littered pavements hint at native alsatians of fearful size; I only have to get past the bus garage - watching out for the sudden rush of a rogue bus at top speed, behind schedule - and soon I come to the Common where, in a fine dusk, I have seen rabbits scuttle at my step, and pocket themselves like billiard balls, into the untrammelled earth. 42 \n￼Occupation A man leans in his shop doorway In the late summer sun; arms folded; Not much custom. People are away, Away from the dusty suburbs. Here the afternoons are so long... He narrows his eyes at the indifferent traffic, The clockwork pigeons, the shufflers With their string bags. He has it in him to be cool under mortar attack; Resourceful in a sandstorm. He has it in him To knock the Chief Librarian\u2019s wife For six, with his Kama Sutra versatility. After long thoughts; after scanning The late racing results, He feels the day turn, and subdue itself Behind the brickwork. In his mind a smell of beer Forms itself, seductively. Grinding his fag-end into the pavement He slams down the shutters. Now, life begins. \n￼Last Words The bird clung to the mesh, powerful and black: its tool-sharp beak working at the metal. Little by little, the keeper\u2019s few words lodged in its brain. One day the feathers at its throat moved and a gruff ventriloquist voice spoke from its beak: \u2018How\u2019s the old boy then?\u2019 The keeper didn\u2019t hear. Last week he\u2019d been retired, after a mauling Been sent off to Perth, to his one relation. He never recovered. The bird, fixing its listeners with a glittering eye, uttered its question time and time again. 60 mammals \n￼Need See the fledgling cuckoo lording it, like a blackmailing lodger. He is all beak. The small birds dart and shuttle, mad to feed him. If an alien child, hungry and rapacious, fixed itself to a woman\u2019s breast, would she nurse it? Need is an undertow that pulls us against our will. Tidying Up Hear the shots at dawn. Multiple murders are taking place O f a sensible kind: The culling of the deer. Animals seen limping May not walk again; Animals which falter and fall Need not apply to rise. In principle I approve of this principle. Such neatness and utility. Why can\u2019t we practise My head itches where the metal would enter. \n￼Short Story As I knocked the cup from the shelf my mind flashed up reprises: that glass you dropped, the dark hotel room, my letter in the rack, your car driving away; a masterpiece of precis. The cup hits the floor. I turn to pick up the pieces. Mutability Some months after it was finished (the raw emotions concreted over) she saw him again, and was amazed at the change. Surely he was shorter by at least an inch; coarser at the neck and waist; the endearing imperfections overtly more imperfect and less endearing; why had he changed so much since she stopped loving him? She smiled in condescending sympathy: but then, so did he. 64 \n￼Chance Meeting Are we the same people - gll that love and rancour Dried up and crumbled away? Now we smile, ask after the children, Pour cups of tea where once we threw them. The antic hay has danced us all apart. We hardly recognise old partners, Or remember the music that sent us round Yearning for the wrong hand. The Innocent \u2018If only she would come back,\u2019 he said, \u2018Everything would be all right.\u2019 What the innocent can\u2019t see are the \u201cif onlys\u201d just over the horizon, spawning and feeding and forming into sub-groups of want and desire. For a moment he thinks he\u2019s made it \u2014 but \u2018Look behind you,\u2019 we cry \u2018Look behind you. I \n￼Cookery Strange how the heat both softens and hardens: T urning sinews to gelatine And liquid batters into crispness and substance Or cricket-bat solidity. Soon, I will take you and feed you My stew. It will be thick, reddish brown, And rich as the beginning of the world. In it will be dark mouthfuls engorged with wine, Crusted and melted with gold and amber tenderness. Rumour of it will reach you from the kitchen, Embarrassing you with saliva - But when you eat, I shall leave the room, For you must be alone to commune With this dark tide, which will flood, Like evangelism, through the blood U nder your pale accountant\u2019s skin. Later, I will sit with you over crumbly meringues And you will smile, under the pearls on your moustache. Such goodness. I know it is right. You will soften and harden for me. \n￼Is It Anything to Worry About, Doctor? Oh no, nothing to worry about. We all have to go in the end. Some of us Would envy you. Better the quick coup Than the messy loiter. Do what you like. Just put your affairs in order. There\u2019s nothing much to worry about - and soon Nothing at all. A Moment of Distraction The water, molten and opaque, Looks fit to lie down on. From the bridge 1can see Two figures to the side of the landscape Doing something on the foreshore, in waders. An urban river, cliffed in With square-shouldered buildings And rusting machinery. Trees on the towpath Festooned with rubbish from high tide. The water looks resilient. I think you could lie down on it. Some men are working on the parapet. \u2018Come on duck,\u2019 one calls, \u2018Don\u2019t do it today. We fished two out yesterday And it\u2019s not in our contract.\u2019 He throws down a stone And the water swallows it neatly. I hurry on. It looks like rain. \n￼Below the Surface This is reparation for something imperfectly remembered, but rooted here. The lolling willows, the silver shadows, all formed a part of it. I look up. The water boatmen scurry round the lilies. There is the meniscus, echoing the curve of the eyeball; also the curve to the horizon. Under my back, the river gravel, my bed and board and shelf life; and here am I, victim of my average weekly yearnings, so peaceful now as all the curves darken, one by one, in harmony. 68 \n￼CENTRAL RESERVATIONS \n￼Clay Pipes Here is the box with the pieces of clay pipe, stems like twigs, bowls swagged and ribbed, all cracked and chipped; but neatly docketed in your schoolboy hand. They were difficult to spot on the river bank amongst the pebbles. We spent hours bent over like ancients, quartering the ground (you in your first adolescence, me in my second). The Thames mud smelled ofbeer from the brewery; fishermen stood peacefully in their waders, while we scrunched and scraped and pounced with nervous absorption. When two pieces jigsawed together you gave your special, satisfied frown. Addictions W e\u2019re all hooked on something: gold or pinchbeck; solitude; a particular pain, the soft option or something harder. Kick one habit and, as you stand quietly at the window, another will dust down that empty chair and setde in. 72 \n￼Bed In this store window, a vast bed, radiant white in satin, lace and crystals, embowered, flounced and veiled: a Swan Lake - an iced cake of a bed; unsullied, intacta. It knows nothing of body fluids, amorous heats, night sweats, birthk, couplings, dyings - such leaky businesses. By this bed, a lover would kneel, slender as a freesia, his samite cuff trailing the floor. Could you relish so immaculate a conception? Central Reservations I\u2019ve just been taught another damn lesson. Is there no end to them? It\u2019s still all life tests, crossroad decisions, multiple choices. Even last words may be subject to assessment: but do we have faith in the examiner? As I ponder this, a voice issues from clouds looming above the window: Trust me, it booms, we know what I am doing. 73 \n￼Compassion Waiting in the supermarket queue with my mange-tout and steak, I gazed abstractedly at the shoes of the woman in front - plastic and misshapen, sticking plaster where one rubbed at the instep. In her basket (her hands grey and knuckly) some small bony meat. She look^ so illimitablv patient and hopeless that the easy tears blurred my eyes at the cash desk. But then I went home again, and I was so busy with my dinner party, you see. Confession One day, she told a stranger on a train everything. After twenty years she didn\u2019t find it easy to begin, but then, encouraged by his faint, grey nods, she fitted words together: explanations, revelations, vindications - the relief was enormous. She touched her face with cambric, feeling shriven. At the next station he rose, creakingly, \u2018So very nice to chat with you, but I fear the conversation was a shade one-sided. This wretched deafness...\u2019 76 \n￼Problem One After a wedding, ten people stay the night in a house which has one W.C. At 9 a.m. the hostess administers 150 ml. tea to each person, and all sip at the rate of 50 ml. per minute. 90% of the guests then fall to planning a furtive sortie to the W.C. - not wishing to attempt fur-tongued, half naked pleasantries en route. The protagonists crouch anxiously behind their door-jambs, like characters in an early French cine-melodrama, struggling to interpret the creak of the floorboards, the click of a door-catch. Suddenly, a youth downstairs staggers from a sofa, pulls on jeans, plods up the stairs to the W.C. and locks himself in. He takes from his pocket a copy of Camus\u2019 The Plague, and settles down for a good read. \n￼Ladies at Lunch Do you remember his hand was shaking - \u2014 \u2014 * -------, \u2014 -ae, and I held the needle over the flame. I don\u2019t think we tried to sterilise the cork. What innocents we were. How deliciously he shocked us: \u2018O f course this is only a m etaphor for sexual penetration.\u2019 He kept stroking the cat absent-mindedly and having to wash his hands all over again. I thought we\u2019d be there all night. \u2018Let\u2019s get on with it,\u2019I said, \u2018or my parents will be back.\u2019 I lay back in the chair and clamped my eyes shut. When I bled all over two linen napkins he went very white. He was much keener on sex than on ear piercing but he hoped that one thing would lead to tire other. Which in time it did, in that bed-sit of his - so bohemian, all lino and frayed edges. We were both foolish, Elena, but at least 1didn\u2019t let him marry me. 78 \n￼Heaven on Earth The loveliest times in all my life my mother told me - near the end of it \u2014 mere when I used to go to the Caledonian Market on Tuesday mornings. I remembered her coming home on those Tuesdays, ruffled, animated, as from an assignation or triumph. Once she brought back a clockwork canary in a wire cage which sang on two notes and gyrated like a tiny feather duster. W hen it dropped off its perch she took it back to the stall quivering with delicious indignation and had it put miraculously right. In those days, she sighed, anything could be made better. Monochrome I want so much to find this empty' room; the quiet light striking the bed into eminence against the shadowed walls. No view. No one calls. It is a retreat. Yet I would not pray there but lie between cool sheets watching the reflection of flowers, pale in their white jar. \n￼Diversions In old age, confined to bed, my mother developed a keen obsession. Lorry jack-knifed on the A14, she would cry as you skirted the commode to greet her: They \u2019II have to leave at Exit 2 and go round here - she had a map on her bedside table: her thin finger quivered. Our small talk, our flowers and chocolates washed up against a tide of burst water mains, spillages, contraflows. We nodded solemnly. She\u2019d gained a nourishing rapport with all the road junctions in the country. Are you sorryyou never travelled? I asked her. She shook her head at my stupidity. Every day, every night, she travelled. 80 \n￼Trouble Ahead In the taxi, in a sweating, static jam, you check your watch again. Your train! You\u2019re bound to miss it. And what about the stranger who is meeting you? Troubled scenarios blossom and race through your head. Someone leans on his horn, and the hooting spreads, like an animal cry through a herd. A bearded man strides back angrily from some crisis point ahead. Christ, can't you wait a few minutes. Someone\u2019s dead. all fall silent Fut it\u2019s an exasperated silence. Death buggers up the traffic no end. People should die in bed. Choice You\u2019re the one I boned up mah jongg for You\u2019re the one I bought the chaise longue for You\u2019re the one I yearn to go wrong for. You\u2019re the one I\u2019ll garden my plot with You\u2019re the one I\u2019ll throwjA in my lot with You\u2019re the one I\u2019ll find my G spot with. You\u2019re the one I\u2019ve had my teeth capped for You\u2019re the one my scruples were scrapped for You\u2019re the one I get all unwrapped for: You\u2019re the one. \n￼Don\u2019t Look Now Today, I have been seeing stairparts. It is best not to look direcdv at the heavy duty fixers, the two-gang pattresses (japanned and countersunk) or the sinisterly named door knob set with escutcheons. The togglers, with their rising butts and easv-on hinges, were hanging around as usual, waiting for straight couplings and high performance cavity screws; but the white-faced hardboard lay motionless and epoxy: it was sashlocked to the roundheads. Entrails I am convinced that digestion is the great secret o f life - REV. SYDNEY SMITH Twenty-two feet of wonders Twenty-two feet of woes: Why we\u2019re obliged to have so many yards of them Nobody really knows. Sometimes they lie retentive, Sometimes they\u2019re wild and free, Sometimes they writhe and get madly expulsive The moment you\u2019re out to tea. 82 \n￼Entrails don\u2019t care for travel, Entrails don\u2019t care for stress: Entrails are better kept folded inside you For outside, they make a mess. Entrails put hara-kiri High on their list of hates: Also they loathe being spread on the carpet While someone haruspicates. Twenty-two feet of wonders Twenty-two fee^of^woes: Why we\u2019re obliged to have so many yards of them Nobody really Imows. Moscow Spring In the Kuskova gardens workmen lift the wooden boxes from the delicate statues. T ender bushes are unwrapped from their overcoats; twigs unbend in the melting light. The men warm to their work; hang their fur hats in a row on the fence. ' |0 _ (j J 83 \n￼Games A rat with his head in a tin enjoys low tide. The river has exposed its flanks of mud and shingle: tusks of wood at the water\u2019s edge speak of mammoths or great amphibians but here on the path we pick our way through artefacts - expanded polystyrene chunky as peppermint toffee; string elaborately knotted; an old bald broom. Joggers thud past miming all degrees of anguish; but the gulls have landed in a drift on the water and are rocking in a trance up and down, up and down, on the wash from the pleasure steamer. 84 \n￼Faidagery Three men in camel overcoats \u2014coarse, moon-faced, slicked-back hair - are sitting in the front row of an audience. They mutter to each other disapprovingly then rise, button their coats and ostentatiously leave, saying: \u2018I can\u2019t stand to see women committing Faidagery.\u2019 It\u2019s not in the dictionary: I look for it when I wake up. But it might be in some arcane tome or medical compendium. One could be committing Faidagery in all innocence. there is always something you do which annoys somebody. o |e / 85 \n￼Jessie\u2019s Bakery This shop, something ofa cult with local inhabitants fo r its delicious hot bread, was closed by the health authorities on the grounds that theflour wasfull ofmoths. Blindfold, you could find it by the reek of stale cats. Big Jessie queens it here, her grey hair dollied up in yellow curls, six days a week. It takes her years to talk your loaf into a bag. The weather never tires of hearing about itself. Flour stirs and settles; hours lag. In fact, time stops. Flies, as if in amber, stiffen in syrup tarts. Sultanas scab the shelves; the customers half remember the world, in its complexity and pain; and, like the lotus eaters, grow averse to facing it again. 86 \n￼Frank\u2019s Journal, December 1878 That morning, it was wonderfully cold. I put a bowl of water on the sill and in an hour it froze. So far, so good. The dog-cart picked me up at half past eight, then we collected Willie, Jack and Fred and up we went to Earith. By the time we started off for Welney, it was ten. My first long run on skates. They went ahead while I got in my stride with less despatch. My face ached from the wind: I had to rest by Bedford\u2019s, but I soon warmed to my work and got to Welch\u2019s Dam by half past twelve: the last six miles took only half an hour. The Welney skaters - fastest in the world \u2014 were marvellous to watch, and there were crowds to cheer them on. The low rays of the sun struck sparks of fiery light from skates and ice. At the Blue Boar we ate a pigeon pie and, taking biscuits and a flask of tea, we turned for home again, against the wind. We ran eight miles and rested by the Dam, then down the counter wash, across the bank and round by Hundred Foot, where just before a lad had drowned (but nof one that we knew). We passed the Dinsdale boys on Bur}' Fen... and after that I slowed, and lagged behind. My legs were made of lead, my hands of ice; the sun had disappeared, the sky was dark; 1 prayed for strength to make myself keep on. 1can\u2019t remember how I reached my goal but Lansdowne James was standing on the bank. n o one. 87 \n￼The Badminton Game That morning, I awoke and went down just as I was, in my green slippers, to look at the hydrangea mariesii - the only flower Clifton allows in the garden, for he must have his trees and shrubs. Out I crept, my slippers darkening in the dew, and hearing a movement beside me I turned and found Ruth. She was carrying the racquets; and so - smiling, not speaking \u2014 we ran between the great bushes to the net, and there we played (quietly, of course, so that Uncle Edward might not hear) until the breakfast gong recalled us. We ran up the backstairs en deshabille, and down the front ones, tardy though decorous, decorous, b u t U3rcUp and kissed Uncle Edward; but I took care to embrace him as he likes best, to forestall reproof. Colour rose up behind his moustache and his face worked silendy, but then he vanished as usual, behind The Times. She\u2019s Nothing But Trouble If she smiles, don\u2019t smile back. But of course you will, like an electrician taking chances with the wiring on a dull Tuesday afternoon. 90 \n￼Albert Memorial Passing the Albert Memorial I remember our night of love, so-called, which started with a concert, and went on to the expensive hotel where we ate our supper - too much, too rich, too noisy - the violinist, with his pander leer fingering and bowing over the stuffed avocado^s and I, like (but unlike) a Vestal Virgin wishing I were home at my sacred hearth. Courage! Courage! This is what is called Life. Put down the hermit\u2019s dish and tackle this hunk of meat - so vigorous it nearly leaps out of its sea of sauce. At last we are in the lift which elevates from Gluttony to Lust. The corridors stretch into infinity; such luxurious cells and here by the bed is a Gideon Bible. I open it, keen for guidance or diversion. Too late! You bend over me, tall as the Albert Memorial, or a tree, take the book and tidy it away, bored with the prologue and ready for the play. \n￼Chacun \u2018That weekend, she lay on the bed as usual, smooth and distant in my arms. W e seemed set for our normal parts \u2014 I, noisy, active, verging on the hysterical; she marmoreal, abstracted among the rucked and musky sheets. And then, this day, she moved: her body chafer to me. Her teeth clenched, a tremor broke in her like power through a fault in the earth. I swung over, hot as fur, and fought her to conclusion. We did not speak. If I laughed, it was only briefly: but when 1left, she slammed the door on me, lock, hook and bolt.\u2019 Leaving Jenkins (extracts from the diary o f a young schoolmaster in 1876) Sunday As I had no timepiece, my own being at the menders, I got up late. A typical Sunday: the Iron Church in the morning, Sunday School this afternoon (the boys unruly both in Jenkins\u2019 class and in my own); a capital sermon this evening. \n￼Tuesday Tomorrow I shall have been on this earth for 21 years. I have resolved, with God\u2019s help, to give a better account of myself within the next year, if spared. W alked to Finsbury Park with Jenkins. Tonight I am reading Pepys\u2019Diary. He seems a man utterly devoid of real, sound principles. W ednesday Received three letters on my birthday, from my mother, my father and Fred. Took singing in the Senior Room while Mr Timpson examined my class in dictation. Jenkins is suffering from indigestion. Went with him to Dr Hill, who charged him l/6d. and told him nothing. Saturday Went to look at the Great Eastern terminus. It is very tastily got up. This evening, M r Sherlock from upstairs brought down his galvanic battery, vacuum tubes, microscope and organ accordion. Talked until 2 a.m. Other lodgers displeased. Saturday To Beavis to be measured for a suit of summer clothes (55/-)- Jenkins ordered a waistcoat. At last made up my mind to see Henry Irving in The Bells. Felt better for it - \n￼If You Come The birds come to feed me. Yesterday one brought bread and today I have a nut, a snail and a berry, red as your mouth. Moving air sighs in the eaves: Le belle indifference I hear, as nightfall rt>bs the trees of a dimension. Messages, of course, I disseminate freely: one behind the clock, one in the knife drawer, one into my letterbox - an oubliette in its own right. If you come, take the aerial route, alighting near the embankment where the backless cupboards and bony umbrellas are all pierced through with heartsease and dock, branches strive through the brickwork and the paving is grouted with moss. In the Summerhouse In the summerhouse you cannot hear your children crying. Plaintive sounds fan out from the far windows and dissipate into the canopy of trees. Everything loosens in the heat, \n￼petals, buds, muslin. Hands unpin your hair... now you hear nothing, but the tick of a watch. The Last Great Fog The fog came down at four, thick and impassive at the windows, and suddenly the office was an island. You walked me home through this strangeness. The buses had given up. An occasional car faltered along the road, its lights describing swirling cylinders of nothingness. The fog set us free. We laughed at everything. We were abroad, unattached, in lunatic spirits: we clung, falling about on kerbstones. You pulled me inside your overcoat and the tweed tasted of fog. The next day dawned bathetically fine. You worked without remission at your desk and I at mine. 107 \n￼Puzzle Picture Here is a puzzle picture. It is a garden: flowers, ferns, a tree, a bush. In it are hidden a man, a woman and a child. The artist is so cunning with his brush. Is that a woman up there in the tree or merely a strange configuration of the boughs? Perhaps she is gazing down through the lush foliage, to where a man\u2019s hand seems to be touching a freckled or can she see two figures lying oddly intertwined; plaits tied in a smiling mouth half hidden by One thing is certain, somebody Tears fall from the tree into the quivering ferns. We cannot call it rain - unless rain burns. 108 knee, ribbon bows, a leaf? is crying. \n￼Waking in the Garden I think I know where I am. A rumbling train shivers the ants in the grass, a branch shifts and groans, my cheek is creased by a rug of folded hills. I cannot make my eyes open. Someone may be near me. A voice cries \u2018havoc\u2019 - but who would use such a word? My heart knocks - the only part of me which can move. A doll I had once would not open her eyes; her blind lids were shellac pink and blank as insolence. We punished and punished her. In the silver distance glasses ring with laughter. Music spools out of a window and is pulled back in again. I concentrate my will - prise open a crack of light which falls on the yolk of a daisy, on the mountainous pores of my arm, of a gargantuan hand which flexes itself in the grass. 109 \n￼Dear Mother I can\u2019t put my finger on it but he\u2019s acting silent and typing out lists of grievances. On the boat he stood me near the rail and told me: lean over, look down at thefish. Now he\u2019s booking our vacation. The brochure shows cliff paths, deep seas, lonely islands. Don 7 worrj\u2019 he sometimes says i f Fate should come between us. We can meet again on the other side. ujc_ \u2018It\u2019s up to You\u2019 \u2018When he\u2019s in a rage - teeth glinting through the beard (which I want to touch), eyes as hot as boiled marbles, it\u2019s like walking on the edge of murder: I know that game. Once, when I was three my mother left me in the kitchen, a sharp knife on the table. Be a good girl. Don 7 touch the knife. I wrapped my finger in my skirt and watched the red soak through. I liked it. You don\u2019t have to cry. It\u2019s up to you.\u2019 118 \n￼Mutual Assured Destruction Once they would eat from the same plate fat black cherries, millefeuilles, mouthfuls of fragrant melon. It was always Tea for Two in those days, but slowly the taste turned bitter; the songs slurred into silence. Now, he sleeps in the basement and her bed is locked upstairs, the sheets stiff, right-angled, unyielding. The solicitors have the matter in hand. Thick white envelopes tongue through the letterbox. At post time, they hover in the hall at the edges of neutral territory, awaiting despatches. \n￼The Waistcoat I had a waistcoat just like that long ago: white pique with tiny pearl buttons all down the front. At that time, Mr Poyntz of the Export Department was in love with me. One evening we went to see Scheherezade, which inflamed and excited him \u2014 after the moderate fashion of the day; but I was safe in his hands behind the serried rank of refractor)', recalcitrant pearl after pearl after pearl. Two Pheasants That first evening they had left the suburbs behind them and were driving through flat fields under the vast Suffolk sky; and as he took her hand, after changing from third to fourth out of a bend, he said Will you come to me tonight? and in the field she saw two pheasants, split-second brilliant in the low sun, and he added: Look, there are two pheasants and she said: Yes, yes, yes. 122 \n￼The Sack One Monday, when I rushed out late for work, an empty, pale-grey plastic sack was huddled by the gate. Should I take it round to the dustbin? Later, perhaps. When I got home, it had wandered down the road, wrapped itself round a lamp post and was flapping. It caught my eye. O f course, a sack cannot wave. Somehow I got used to seeing it about. Thursday was dustbin day, but on Friday it appeared again - breaking cover, perhaps, from behind a hedge. It had certain childlike traits: dragging at one\u2019s legs for attention; failing to pursue a fixed course of action; inspiring a wry affection. Sometimes at dusk - for a joke \u2014 it took on fanciful, chimerical forms and lurked, changing its shape, behind the postbox. It was a pantomime of versatility. Some days it slapped up and down on the pavement. Once it undulated up a tree. It hated the wet more than anything. Disconcertingly, this morning it has gone. No one has seen it. It is not in anyone\u2019s front garden, and I do not like to knock and ask if it is round the back. Things come and go, and when they go, you feel the lack. 123 ","docTitle":"","docDate":"2014-07-01 09:46:09.489"},"meta":{"contentType":"text/raw","emVer":"7.1.1103.5","langIdVer":"DefaultLangId","processingVer":"CalaisJob01","submissionDate":"2014-07-01 09:46:01.933","submitterCode":"57b17a53-6e34-87b0-20ff-a419896f49c9","signature":"digestalg-1|l4+CWQ/kDXeYqNDmvSx7dylUfrE=|MzRrEhfat5DTwlBIuy65EwCeycxzFfvS4IykFKecWddQqhvtx/X1qw==","language":"English"}},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/dba60969-4ae3-3b8e-b560-b11540d3533f/lid/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http://d.opencalais.com/lid/DefaultLangId/English"},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/8942f1d9-f126-3e4a-b792-dce7a6a2a03f":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"Position","name":"Librarian","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/Position","instances":[{"detection":"[ a sandstorm.
