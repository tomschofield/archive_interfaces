That\u2019s how come we get on so well, so long. You smile, you picture black seamed stockings, white muslin crown on hair that\u2019s poised to be let down? No, she is not Naughty Lola - no^Mrs iMopp! With us it is importunate to talk or stare; touch is right out. This fortunate proximity is all we share. She has arrived. You are in the backroom, by the Steinway, fiddling with the Blues. You hear her humming as she moves among the papers and abandoned meals, clearing up the ashtrays, scripts and coffee cups, the litter of aloneness. Redeeming fingers touch your old scores lightly, as if it were yourself she dusts and settles on the shelf. Praise the maid who sets out flowers and white clouds where you might see them and be glad! The htpijfcAvould be total were it not for her. The Maid & I Now she is singing an old refrain you can\u2019t quite...The sky is pale, washed clean by rain, hung up against the evening. As you attend, a melody floats through apartment walls so intimately it is as though you quote yourself - debris is sorted, order is invented or restored. Now she is done. You will work on alone but that\u2019s all right. Grace must have its means. She flicks the light on as she leaves. 48 \n￼Wallace Stevens in East Fife If it is anywhere, it must be everywhere - the mind stumbles after the divine finding nowhere to halt or grip. It must be the bush and the wind that wrassles it, the invisible shook by the visible, the howl shaken from wind by telephone lines. It must be speech on the phone and the silence that resumes and speech resuming that conversation between speech and silence which so shook Sam B., discerning howl in music, music in the throat of howl. It must be anytime and at all times, in the living man and the dead, in the greatcoat stumbling on the coast, in the grey coast stumbling through the head. \n￼A North Sea Twist-ofT I got oiled on my last night on-shore, recalling lovers thrown over shoulders like peel so we could read the initial of the one we shoulda married or eaten whole...These drastic shifts caught up wi me; if I\u2019d worked today I woulda crushed my hands. So I\u2019ve arranged things so I can\u2019t, wrote off fifty grand\u2019s machinery. It has long been my ambition to make a major blunder; now I\u2019ve succeeded, for today at least. The shaft is plugged, it\u2019ll take days more to extract the cock-up from the core. # Too much was going down. We grouped like para-medics round a cardiac arrest to bolt another section to our mile-long probe. I did it then. Some suspect, nane saw t^^flick of the wrist. We swarmed in oilskins around catastrophe, pumped down urgent cooling mud, muttered soothing angry words, Come on beauty, donVbreakoffnow...Too late. The twist-off was complete. We shrugged, separated, hurt by our incompetence, glad of the break. \n￼I need the money, I need the work, I need the green grease on my palms. These are the first and last, the fast realities that let us roar to vanishing-point on our machines. But there are times I canna watch the whining, blurry revolutions screw the planet and ourselves as we shudder into pay-dirt. Yet I\u2019m convinced I need the money, so I do. # We can\u2019t work till the technicians come. Could stay on, doing nothing on half-pay, skimming girlie mags...I\u2019ll pass, chopper out and lie for days somewhere, a long-abandoned spanner in the grass, rusting, unadjustable. She phone frae Ullapool last night, thick with the cold, or maybe she These needs that grow... It was fun once, now I\u2019ve packed my gear - let\u2019s go. Boom-time\u2019s over and we aa got shafted. \n￼Bagatelle Dreams A Canadian rock star has \u2018a had case offlu \u2019 TRACK A My doctor said I have nervous exhaustion. This must be why I\u2019m water-skiing on my back along a blue canal. The wake fans out. I cannot see what\u2019s coming but there is no fear, all is blue rush and surrender. Bless the doctors for this ride of unexamined joy! My nerves are young in summer; above, the boat\u2019s exhaust makes temporary clouds... TRACK B I need a holiday, this must be why I\u2019m side-stepping the concrete bagatelle of Yonge Street\u2019s high arcade. Muggers? No fear! I\u2019m wearing elbow-length gauntlets, my blue plexi-glass diver\u2019s helmet \u2014I out-weird everyone here. When the steel ball thunders, I wrap around it, waving goodbye. I am being rolled head-first towards m ore... FIRST MIX The doctor said I need a nervous holiday. This must be why I\u2019m back skiing high on a street canal, young fans in my wake. I\u2019m wearing elbow-length muggers and unexamined joy - doctoring the weird! All is Blues rush and plexi, a bit mixed. No fear yet - thunder is a blessing, the boat steals the gauntlet. My nerves are rapping, temporarily exhausting the clouds... **/ 52 \n￼SIDE-TRACK (second mix) Wake, wake. This is your head doctor. We must be concrete now. No rush, no fear. Exhausting to step from dreams into another blessed arcade? You get so mixed. There are no muggers, no bagatelles. Waking is temporary? Balls! You need a summer holiday from plexi-fans. Blue Gauntlet, believe me these pills will see you examining the clouds. FINAL MIX Is this concrete, or unexamined dream? A plexi-question! Exhaust it in surrender. I can\u2019t wear waking, my head skis 0/ the high canals. Fear is at elbow-length - will doctor turn mugger, or wave diverse gaundets? Thunderous nerves! The Neil Young fans are singing \u20180 Steel Summer Clouds[ ^ as they carry me waving to the Arcadian ball... \n￼In an Italian Field In the dazzling world the peasants are working. With bowed heads and backs they drag in line their dark comb through a field of corn. They will never get rich. They will never live in bought houses. Their lives will remain obscure as their dialect, secret as the women\u2019s hair. Bent as their sickles they shuffle on. One sings, another mops her brow. At each row\u2019s end they pass the jug around, at noon chew bread, spit, then sit for an hour beneath the poplar trees and silently rise up again... No wonder we feel flimsy, returning to our books. The pages blur, letters start to wave before our eyes - we are unfocused by the glare outside where a sickle flashes at the margin of a field, its shape unchanging as the great stalks yield. 54 \n￼Aide Memoire Being eighteen, light-headed, hormonal, daft, there is much to be said for it. I said it at length on the Fife coast that winter. I donned my Doric cap, took a stiff whisky, walked out the door. In town the lights were blazing but no one was at home. What of the white line I toed by the sea? The wind blew apart the clouds round the moon and I stepped through. \n￼The House-Builder Variations A workshop - principal materials: saw, drill, rule, nails, a plain deal table Unemployed? Growing rusty? You want a house that is unique - home in on this! Here\u2019s your drill, the hammer-action for concrete, this is your saw, your rule, your plain deal table. These are the trees. The compassionate State awards you with a gross of nails. Such are your true materials. Confused? You want to shelve it for today? Believe me, if you pass on children you must make something of your own, or live aloner than alone. A better deal! Unemployed, not unique, this was his drill: plane it true, hammer the State, nail it to a tree. But the old saws were rusty, the rule was bent, he made nothing at the table. (He could have said it in spades, but spades are disallowed materials - you think association\u2019s free?) What frame could house such passion? It must be concrete, too gross to shelve. Confused, alone, he passes on today. Concrete poems? A house of cards, shuffle them as you will! Deal anyway. What was it she saw that made the trees seem jungular today? (Nothing\u2019s disallowed, but old drills are bent as is the State and its materials.) As a rule, truth\u2019s a shelf that takes unique confusion to nail it to the wall. Unemployment takes a hammering today as she sits making passionate children in her swaying home high in the trees. 56 \n￼Here\u2019s what I saw when I took that hammering: alone is gross. Let us live in free association, where is not material. Plain dealing! Believe me (though I am swaying), a bent rule is unique. We shall be shelf-employed! Today is concrete passion. Nail down this truth: I love you though the drill be rusty and the state confused. \n￼Japan A Romance o f Two Empires \u2018No empire in debt has ever lasted long\u2019 - gore vidal Love fell on you, twice. The world turned white. You vanished, you became a shadow on the wall. The war ended. You came back from the dead, speaking our language, meaning business. This time you would produce the goods. We met her on time at the American movie. We sat through it twice till we could make it better. Then we kissed and took her home. None o f us had anything to lose and after all we made it cheaper and we made it best. Now your round e)>esflicker when we stir. You kiss our neck, we like that. Energetically, we takeyou again. You try hard to please. You do. You will. For the most part our protests are conventional as we subside; arms are weak when we are in your debt. And though we sulk, remembering our time of power, for the most part we were tired of Empire. 58 \n￼This is the reconstruction, our royal we need not be discussed. You will accept reversal in good time. Aspire to our eyes and be a credit. You were tired and we need each other, ofcourse we do. This is only the old order renewed. It will be a relief to be so in love, to be colonised in turn, repent and loose the burden of our power. Here in the shadow of our master\u2019s kimono we bite our fingernails and aspire. \n￼Homage to Master Berryman Sunk sloop John B., I have to talk at you^ seeing you around no more. (Slid off the bridge, waved not.) Give me your due deaf ear & pardon, who hassled audience with Yeats before you was halfways great. high-minded & randy, compulsive chaser, awful and true. Suffered for it too - booming out & cringing in, rampant & trembling for thirty years. Resigned great shade, those ways are out: Well-mannered, discreet, soberly polishing the obvious \u2014Are thesefolks for real? you enquire. Who live by the word must be ready to die by it. Else not serious people. I don\u2019t want be badly & cracked! But that's the deal, But...for this Dream Song form, John, I need more lines - Thanks. Art, decency, sanity - can\u2019t square it? Loopy Cal, Mr Lowell toyou, scampered under my tree all afternoon, throwing up sticks. We laughed, werebrieflyhappy(5unmarked. Werenotallsobad.Therewereothers honed for the chop? One Them dislocations still appeal - appalling we dream of reputation, and we fall in line. claimed dying was an art, did it so badly shefinally succeeded. And succeeded, And your fearful double Henry, sunk with his gripes & lust & glass? Yet raged & wept at McCarthy, the dying children in Delhi. And deluded Delmore, Anne who tolled too early \u2014 All you crazy bad and great: wus Serious People, pal. Were you still with us I could not breathe, you being too much. Brow-beater \u2014 tearful, fearful, loyal & all - I take my leave. My times you urge and warn and flash dark lightning exact. I commit you & salute one friend of timing wayward, absolute. 60 \n￼Mexico \u2018Dona Barbara, que devora a los hombres \u2019 In the truck she let the Octopus open her shirt, also the blonde divorcee\u2019s - it was her dive through dark heat, she could not rise till everything was lifted from her. She had kept herself apart for years, virtuous, no affairs with lecturers as she surveyed the glittering surface and swell of Yanqui power. Night rose round her and she laughed, appalled, assenting as he gripped the blonde heads back, rinsed mouths with beer and marijuana. Out the window her hand spread, released wallet and I.D. What a burden righteousness becomes! The divorcee peeled mangofc with her nails, licked dark fingers one by one before inserting them beneath her skirt. Cooler up front with the driver who drank white rum and kissed her eyes while he spoke poetry about the moon flowering over Vera Cruz, the shack where she could stay, indebted, in roses, good and chattel like his country to the Yanqui dollar. Headlights skewered the jungle, her eyes streamed. He spoke beautifully but was gentle-souled, was not the Octopus who devoured gringa. She buttoned her shirt and clambered back. The divorcee lay unconscious on the sacks, graceless, released. What had passed here? The Octopus shrugged. Self-respect had kept her on the surface all these years, buoyed up by her critique - time to meet what lay beneath. \n￼There was sand, water, men in a circle, some ceremony she could not master nor deconstruct away. One shot white arrows at the moon and fell twitching, ecstatic. The Octopus took peyote, his tongues thrust mush into her mouth; she nodded, choked, tore off her shirt and spun the world round her jittery hips as though it were a hula-hoop and she a child in her Mid-West backyard. None looked her way, he swam, she could still run for it. He found her dreaming on the sand, arrow in her fist. Crossing himself, Dona Barbara, he took her to the truck. Conscious and unconscious breasts compared were found wanting. Leeched upon, she strained to drain into his mouth; her inverted nipple hurt, swelled, would not come free. Another town, she stumbled out for beer and tacos - no shirt, no money, still she knew blonde hair, white skin would see her through, and despaired. How may power resign from its high place? This nervy diver had come teetering to the edge... At the end there was a room. Men sleeping stirred in their hammocks when she plunged to meet the Octopus in the tightening net. They grappled, clasped, fought limb to limb, snapped beak to beak till in the mesh he suckered the Barbarian. She clasped the arrow, he rose shouting - puddled, ecstatic, she drifted while he lay harpooned. Then there were many hands, some kind. 62 \n￼They carried her out at dawn, trembling, bloody, white as salt. A bus pulled up, she gripped her blanket then rose and in the loving tongue she mastered her first lie. * Her thumb on the inside of my arm still lightly stroked the vein. We lay in her hammock strung above the porch, Toronto, Little Italy; the old insomniac next door pruned tomatoes in the dark and hummed his exile, it would soon be day. \u2018But that was in another country and besides, the hombre\u2019s dead.' I held her, sweating, knowing she\u2019d said all that she would say.
