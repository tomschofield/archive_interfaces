They waited by our sides, like aeroplanes, or graves, enclosed in silk, dusty and sweet like sponge cakes or carnations; we must have lain exhausted at their feet for many days and nights; we saw the moon unroll ten thousand miles of suffering along their backs, as if the mane of one alone were Upper Burma, as if each fetlock were Mongolia, where there\u2019s only fifteen^ miles of tarmac-ed road, the rest\u2019s small flowers... What happened next, my friend, you already know - something it\u2019s hard for the people here to believe, after the reign of abuse we\u2019ve been subjected to, timid as we are, for so long now. G 131 \n￼Evelyn All I do's admire the distant sky-line and run my fingers through the rustly dand while Evelyn,ever patient and resourceful, trundles off in search of tasty ants. And every night,at peace beneath the stars, we think about the zoo-raan in his bedroom battling with his large electric fan. We S^Stta&ise him getting out of bed and switching off,not only his supoly, but everyone's.The whole population's. .nd everything goes ominously quiet. Then gradually,as dawn begins to break, he sees to his astonishment strange animals shuffling up his drive with their families; and as the days go by he gets to like them - in fact he can't imagine ever not. They fill his house and gardens with their normalness.Just the way they seem so down-to-earth.
