And everyone\u2019s so kind. And seems to know me. It\u2019s like a sort of friendly hotel. But all the same it doesn\u2019t feel quite right. I sometimes wonder if there\u2019s some mistake. And if my other life\u2019s still going on. And where my friends are; and the house I knew. Who booked me into this one, anyway? Ask. Why don\u2019t I simply ask someone? A I\u2019ll ask this person trimming the hydrangeas. Maybe he\u2019s my son. You never know. What I want to know is Is it serious? And do I live here? Normally, I mean. Or is it just a joke? An exercise? How boring of me if it is. I\u2019m sorry! Perhaps there\u2019s someone I can talk to somewhere? Or is it up to me to do whatever? \u2018Thanks-a-lot-I\u2019ll-take-it\u2019 type of thing? The nice hydrangea man says feel free. It sounds so easy, doesn\u2019t it - feel free? \n￼A nightdress Sprinkled w'th ?ish-Scales. After what the family call 'the accident' my sister brought me here,to this small castle that rises from the shores of a lake rumoured to be one of the deeoest, certainly the clearest,in the country. And when I say I fish'from my bed \u2019 I mean exactly that.Have a look. Swimming may no longer be an option but fishing is.I lay them on my bed, cold and heavy like abandonned guns, and tell myself how fortunate I am. The doctor,quite a fisherman himself, sometimes finds a scale,like confetti, sticking to my nightdress or my bandages, and pities them carefully off,like tiny mirrors, before he turns away to join the swimmers fanning out across my bedside lake.
