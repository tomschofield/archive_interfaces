If I were with you, I am not sure I could do it: I would crack at the lungs in the tank of water, my hands still tied, or lose the race with the fire at the cable\u2019s end, letting you down in the act in front of an audience. I am half in love with knots, their twining intricacy, the twist and twist again of thigh-thick ships\u2019 ropes where they lie across wharves, the immense chains in swathes and drifts on the side of the dock. It is difficult to leave, to cast loose the moorings however rusty, however the cranes have been dismantled and the cuts and backs left mainly to swans and drifting garbage... Anyway, I have no part in your escaping drama unless as a handkerchief-waver growing smaller, unless as a spectator on the edge of the wondering crowd as you step from your bonds with a casual salutation, step into some limousine that waits for you with its engine quitj8jy running, and run away from the rest of us struck immobile by your going. \n￼Austin 9-34 10/2/93 4:55 pm Page 17 The New World To begin again - going in either direction, but ever between east and west, proclaiming some relation to the sun that is infinitely old yet new and new again... Those girls from Trinidad, with suitcases lined with khus khus and gold rings in their ears, flew east to an English convent school as much in search of the new as Ralegh going to Guiana: his Eden - infinitely old and yet a virgin land, unriven by the plough. The sun drags - or repels. Pale from a string of English winters then wracked with prison agues, that tall knight yearned after sun, went with it, ever towards the west, keeping it in his sight as long as might be. Those girls were white with a tropical enervation from lives spent on shaded verandahs, driven in by noon, and the shutters closed. Their first English snows were a wonder - some million camellia petals shed; and for Ralegh there were oysters that clung to the strange mangrove branches, then Trinidad\u2019s lake of black pitch. / 17 \n￼Austin 9-34 10/2/93 4:55 pm Page 18 To Ralegh in the Tower Your prison bulks against the sky in the remembered way; but framing its black is an orange-grey darkness that distracts from the navigators\u2019 lights - a girl born in Golders Green, in good faith told me, \u2018There are no stars over London.\u2019...Sometimes the moon breaks through like a white-knuckled fist or a pale fingernail that scratches at the eyes. How rarely any kind of moon coincides with your small window. A candle has to do for that bright ship bearing its Cynthia or Diana through the sky. How the moon extends the night, spreading it like a table with extraordinary linen! How a candle gathers a room in rings towards it, holds the walls tight against its flame! You spread your page in this restricted circle, asking the world to settle there. You read the stars in the gap in your prison wall, building broad constellations, maps of heaven, out of their wheeling fragments. I try to recreate you whole. Against the odds. Here ravens take the fresh meat they are given and bury it to putrefy, ripe for eating. They are sleek, strutting close to our shoes with knowing eyes. They monitor disintegration. Blood spills. A head lies at its owner\u2019s warm feet. Your embalmed skull is kept from your body\u2019s grave. Just so the body\u2019s prison holds you inside these wraps of stone, away from real vision of green Guianan forests where the deer come down to drink, or of the ocean in the sunshine all-over silver-slashed with flying fish. I think of Lake Como, where fishes in the shallows swim as dense and ordered as rain falling lying down. 18 \n￼Q) .^ fl/ t / o ru on such a page, where the borders of light and wet are overlapping. In the abbey\u2019s open ruins, holes brim in the lace, absence is more substantial than the stone; in the moat below the cathedral, reflections of brilliant swans waver, are sunlight tunnelling through dark (the building up above them bleaches out); in a brick house in winter, islanded by flood, wave after wave of light breaks on the ceiling. 20 Austin 9-34 10/2/93 4:55 pm Page 20 Drawings of Water A country stated, on the page, laid flat (flat above all things) and exactly limned as for a Book of Hours: colour^ground down from jewels \u2014shining, little, in my hands. Palms draw apart to mark the borders, book ends - the two towers (or, one a bundle, bunch of towers, the other lopped and broken). Right or left irrelevant: cathedral, abbey ruin, land and the sky between. Big sky, low land and little, criss-crossed with water lines; stiff trees like sprouting pencils sticking up into a dome\u2019s interior of cloud \u2014or wind, leaning, leaning against the towers, trees and black ticks of birds. Land shines with water, scrawls an idle moving light across white ceilings of occasional brick houses jewelled with wet. 2 I remember a marvellous dream of that country\u2019s annual flood, when ditches and rivers, rising, overlaid the land with a thin water skin no deeper (in this dream) than any shoe sole; and I looked down upon it from much higher than a bird, seeing flat shining water slip under ruffled sea - as simply as one piece of paper slides underneath another. I should like to draw ^ . . aor s \n￼Austin 9-34 10/2/93 4:55 pm Page 21 & The Dresses n / They contain someone; as a painted china jug contains the orange juice or milk, the dresses stand, and she within them is more liquid than the pink, the white, the blue - hanging from left to right along one shortish wall inside Vienna\u2019s Kunsthistorisches Museum. I know her name. I read it on the labels that motion once again the white, the blue, the pink: \u2018The Infanta Margarita Teresa in...\u2019 and then the jug identified, its colour fixed against the potential centuries of fading; meanwhile the royal child recedes... In several senses: you have to look her up to find her provenance among the Spanish Hapsburgs, the marriage to an Austrian uncle that brought her portraits here; and still she is not known in any real way, though blue and pink and white can claim lifelong acquaintance. Besides, track her from left to right and watch her self withdraw, the head and hands each time less of the picture, smaller proportion of the whole in which the pink and white and blue balloon, reach to the gilded frame, invade the corners. And on her face a lessening assertion: she who, at two or three, in pink, stared back towards Velazquez somewhat crossly, by five, in white, is dutifully a model; and - in inflated blue, trapunto-trimmed, encumbered by a dark fur tube of muff depending from her fingers and longer than her arm, while from her other hand some rosettes hang - at eight has come to be possessed by doubt. She has her dignity, but confidence is gone, her glance would sidle past us if it could; what she can look out on has made her anxious. 21 \n￼Austin 9-34 10/2/93 4:55 pm Page 22 I want to say, this girl-child has the bluesy teal hue of the embellished swollen jug tints the thin milk within, until this last dress of the series usurps her eyes and skin, goes on beyond its wristbands and lace collar - wins.
