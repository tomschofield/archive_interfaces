How can I tell you? Ve had seen no habitation in two months. Brown dogs twitched in the shade, a chicken screamed; we smelled dung, dall, smoke, lentils; many voices, the bronze fields shone. Lean as schoolmasters, tall wheat rapped our knuckles as we limped into the square. Say there are miracles between where babies twitch and sleep and old folk sleep and totter. Vater-mills spun, yaks plonked circles round the threshing floor. Evening prayers, a sleeping miller, tawny goats stole husks of wheat. Goitres hung like apples on the children's necks. The Hadji lightly touched our backs, Summit good Ve had been above ourselves, hooked to pure worlds of black & white & blue, the narrow world pf^eping bags. In Askole we sat\u2014wlth-lmur-kind till dawn theij r^ose and crossed the river, Bound1ou-r porters, jeep did the rest. Ve broke down, sang 'It will come hard to sleep on beds as soft and wide as ours. ' \n￼/ THE VIITER CLIKBIMG For Marj It is late January and at last the snow. I lie back dreaming about Glencoe as fluent, hungry, dressed in red, you climb up and over me. That passion claimed the darkest, useless months for risk and play. You rise up on me, I rise through you ... The shadowed face of Aonach Dubh where Mai first took me climbing and as we clanked exhausted, happy, downwards through the dark, I asked 1Vhat route was that?' 'Call it what you want - it's new.' You reach the top and exit out; from way above, your cry comes down. ' The rope pulls tight. Vhat shall we call this new thing we're about? These days we live betaking care and chances,-*\u2019Des^t name it? my heart is in my mouth as I shout Climbing ... \n￼CRUX Delicate, hell-cat, at the crux on Hoy, last word in day-long converse with rock above deep blue, climbing into pale blue, aiming for grace - A hard way to be normal. The gods of agility took him this far, 800 feet, soloing and high an that mug's game. Row they desert him. His fingers stutter below the bulge - he's run out of ways to speak to sandstone. Gripped? Mummified. This rock is smooth as political tongues. Hung from a hand-jam, rock crystals enquire of his skin How much you want to live, sweet youth? Some questions draw blood and pride equally, he answers, smears his right foot, r gets his left edged high. Chalk-bag, pinch-grip ... Now he's kiltered out, all trussed up and nowhere to go. The world waits with casual interest. Gooseflesh, a draught blows through from the next world - going there soon? Adhesion's mostly faith for intricate movers but he's shivering agnostic now releasing the hand-jam he stretches his right boot slips right hand up fast as a prayer grabs his Grail o lovely jug then cranks like a maniac over the bulge. Thugged it to the top, sat and was blank, was gone, was everywhere in Orkney longlight., Ve met him in Stromness, it was etched in his eyes he'd dipped deep into more than his chalk-bag that day. Vhite as cocaine his fingers drummed the bar, awaiting tequila. 'Been pushing the envelope, matey?' His eyes were mica as he considered our question, glinting and flakey his smile: 'Aye, licked the stamp too.' Revving kite on a taut string, could plummet or soar - delicate hell-cat, you'll do. \n￼THREE ABOVE IAXCHE BAZAAR Heading for Lhotse Sandy, feeling somewhat queasy, squatted above Mamche, shat a foot-long worm. My life's like that, he said as we laughed and took our photographs, a thread of consistency through unconsolidated crap. - All things pass as expeditions through the Bazaar, joking & jiving & ripping each other off. Got a bad feeling about this trip, boss. Some days you scoff and scoff but just get thinner, Mai grinned. Had a friend, dead now, he always swallowed a tape-warm before he came this way - never got ill. He'd say just to be here, we must have been promoted. - Think that's true? A monk once stopped me on the trail below Temboche monastery, said he saw death in my eyes, rasfe I'm wondering whose..., Ve rounded the corner and there - the big Mothers: Huptse, Lhotse, Everest. My heart battered in my chest like a man beating on the walls of the cage surrounding him and I thought huh Climbing - this bad bug kills off all the rest. / \n￼AFTER EVEREST Between one expedition and the next we buried the tiny Buddha's bones upright, with respect, at the bottom of the garden. Then we were driven back to the mountain. Between the highway and the ditch the restless Vest verges on its limit ... Ro one said we are too old to die young, too young to retire as we left Lhasa in dust. \n￼AVALAICHE He's at it again, first time in years a woman's hips hands eyes, wherever the categorical resides, have issued the imperative Screw our lights out. Hot bulb! (Cooling in the dark.) Sweating in sheets he regards her where she lies face down. The terror lies in the tenderness derived between the slope and shiftings of her ribs.
