The sorrow is palpable, It freezes doves in their tracks.

We were born dead. To mine the ice from our eyes. Turneresque Throw open all the windows then Where genius painted glass And mortals may walk through Without receiving A shard to the heart. The dainty white glove Has arrested the organ And doves dip their wings Strike out at canvass. Down fuels us And then the angels Who touch men Make them mad.

How my eyes herded her three times a week for years. For years she brought my watercress and letters And only here and now I ponder Because the snow has pinched her tattered cheeks And sucked the ancient blood she needed To get her up the lane in winter, How she had to tread cut glass to water, Spoke to me from duty, never pleasure. Here is the old woman who brings my watercress and letters Three times a week, three miles through sun or snow Invisible and unremarked for years. The shepherdess, her lambs long gone for slaughter. No complaint on her cracked lips which are a wound Wearing salt, the things she could say and doesn\u2019t. My salads sprout out of her fist and she transfers them Tenderly, She struggles home in sackcloth, I watch her crook the snow by the neck, unpile it From her path. And then I don\u2019t think of her again. But she brought to mind a waterfall once seen Falling upwards by force of unnatural weather. It peeled off in violent geysers of rainbow hue Defying every assumption of how, and where, Water should fall. Snowdrop He sentencedaiie to be a man.
