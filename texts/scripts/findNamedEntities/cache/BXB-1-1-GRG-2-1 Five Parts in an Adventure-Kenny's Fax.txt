Biographical notes from that performance are reproduced at the end of this Programme, and may helpfully be referred to now or during the two Intervals. (The insomniacs' bar remains open throughout.) Dramatis personae The part of Grimpeur is played by Ken, as in 'you ken' or the philosopher Anthony Kenny: a knowing man, the doubt-filled intellect. The head. Poet is now played by Stella, and much improved for it. The scene-setter, the heart. The role of Axe-Man is taken by Brock - a surly badger or Pictish stronghold. The body, and its music. The Zen Climber/ The Bear is now the Heretical Buddha, a.k.a. Bud, H.B. Who's he? Put it this way: if the three principal characters were three legs of a stool, the Heretical Buddha would be the seat. Also featuring 'I':W» Narrator, speaker and listener, the Company as collective, the Holding Company for Heretical Buddha Productions, a.k.a. Ananda (see end notes), Drew-baby. I is the one who sits upon that stool. But already the lights are going down, the background fades. Please find a comfortable place, a stool for instance, a seat, or a bed. Darkness. The sound of the sea. As eyes adjust we become aware of a reading' lamp, a solitary reader, a bed, and a few cues. Such as: \n￼THE HERETICAL BUDDHA or THE DEBATABLE LANDS Three Parts in An Adventure Part I: The Up & Down Disco (the Company) Part II: Some Time in Morocco (the Sheath) Part III: The Debatable Lands (the Knife) Yes we'11 catch the wisdom train but why arrive too early at the station? - Bud \n￼F>/=tCrL.

And haven't we seen it wasted on yet another grotty scheme? Utterly unmortgageable at four in the morning you lean on the windowsill pain in the chest but still calling the bluff and hear at last the sea make sense the sense you began to make when you owned up and said 'I am afraid'. This is as good a place to start as any. \n￼LIGHTS LJF> DIM Scotland. January. Snow. A mean old day gloomily shutting up shop. We see a rusting questing 2CV shoogle over Cairn '0 Mount with two last-minute customers ... 'This salted road's a thin black tawse whacked down on Rannoch Moor.' Crack! The wiper blade breaks off. That'll learn ya, son, the Buddha spat then with a sigh leant out and cleared the windscreen with his brolly, anthropocentrism makes you blind, a kind of beating your own trumpet. He huddled deeper in his cloak and warmed as was his way to his subject (which was as well for with the window open to permit the passage of his brolly it was bloody freezing as I steered into another change of tense and personnel that lies across our way like ice) Night as well call the punitive tawse ^ O\u2019h-y'in -ham nff -t-Tna 483, yOUr palm I hold out my hand and wait. At length the Buddha shakes his head, gently places my fingers back upon the wheel: I read: a violent culture, great wilderness in the heart. Above the whirring shoe-box a hoodie craw veered North. I scanned for something dead or dying, thought of my friend Donald, HIV positive, two tendons cut by a Stanley knife when he came in on my account when I was jumped \n￼by Casuals In Queensferry between chip-shop and Chinese takeaway 'Sure thing,\u2019 I said, 'but mine own.' The white palm dipped beneath the blow and we declined towards Glencoe, hands tight and careful on the wheel. It's narration of a sort when someone salts the road for us a long black line across the white-out below the Buchaille Etive Mor and lets us wind down like a clock to stop outside the Clachaig Inn. 'Let's enter. I have friends here.' \n￼It It Who reigns here? is not Concrete (that way lies fascism and no fun) is not Scale (easy to be depressed by the size of your wee self standing shivering at the crease below the advancing moon amid an ever-expanding slip field of stars, waiting for History's next blink-and-you've-missed-it de1ivery. Na, don't be too impressed by Scale!) Nor Force of Arms (here, if a desperate character pops in with a gun what shoots out is lettered: BANG!) And you'll be noticing the tendency to change name, sex and destiny not to mention subject, season and location, and if this History runs on iron rails it is only those of sound and rhythm while the sweaty driver whistles ©samples' from all eras as he whacks new vocals down on those gleaming tracks - Who reigns here? I say the door of the Clachaig opens on a street in Katmundu; say and we are walking with the Heretical Buddha at dusk, past Hindu shrines; you'll note the fruit bats like inverted priests hung in dusty eucalyptus trees, incense, spice and sweet-sour piss churned by passing bicycles; the wind stirs in merely mentioned trees and we - Slam that door shut! Later ... You take the point. This is not the concrete world and everything here bends (when you incline your ear) faster than plastic when you credit it. \n￼Got all that? Good. Knew you would.

'Ach, Daith - ower blate tae dance wi me?' Man of Earth, son of the Earth-shaker, bleeding bull and rolling thunder, all too mortal rock 'n\u2019roller, rocking round Earth's diurnal course, rolling the stones and trees, needle-tormented Orpheus torn in clan leather - 'FAUGGHHH! Je me lance vers la gloire, pal! ' He rolls to his feet and Up and Out. ' ...and the mighty earth thundered with a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand voices, declaring 'I bear you witness! '. And the demon fled. ' (Bud say: There are other ways than purity. Our power's in the flow between the light side and the dark. Excise it with prayer and discipline? You might as well fillet the fish then ask it to swim ...) \n￼STELLA ESCAPING WITH BUDDHA *■ I - As I left the hospital with you early under dripping trees, optics, sonics, motion in full flow - I didn't know there'd be so many bits of me to find. I must make a way through a world that may never conspire again, nor sing ? its praises. \n￼CUT TO Brock's pushing his luck as you or I might push a pun to the limit. Ach, that's what it's for, says he, stroking the gleaming dropped cadence of the handlebars. A chancy man! Loosen the clench and the fist vanishes: that's him. He's shorn his locks wi flint, close to the skull and dangerous. I knew him once years back when he was mega but this world's no longer fit for guitar heroes any more than dinosaurs (whom they curiously res^embled in brain power and leathery skin as they thundered 'cross the stage through steam and primal grandeur) and I grieve to see one arm awry, one leg shorter than the other and I guess he's trying to adapt or find some spot to die. He shivers, coughs. Either way: Mad Max he ain't. But he's on the move, his emblematic transport British made, a burnt-out Norton. He pushed it till he'd made his point, now ditches it, limps on alone with his sole instrument the fret less bass Raw Power - I hear him whistle as he leans into the wind, forcing the way open like a stubborn door. His destination? Oh, very well - Nepal. Through the monsoon he runs a voodoo rave in down-town Katmundu: hard-core groove. \n￼Crag-rats & Goths hang out there with Sherpas, cops and double-dealers - if you want to blend, the colour's black and silver.
