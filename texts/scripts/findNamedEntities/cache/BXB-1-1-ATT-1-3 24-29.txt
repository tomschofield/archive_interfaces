A High Court Judge called Judge Richards ruled that a woman who was hitch-hiking late at night and was picked up and raped was \u2018asking for it\u2019 and guilty of contributory negligence...

'Tm-WHtTE-TfOUSE Spring 1991 : *> Dear Saddam (or can I call you Keying Well, it\u2019s all going wonderfully according to plan - the arms dealers are absolutely over the moon, the best sales demonstration in history, and we\u2019ll split the commission 50-50 as arranged - just don\u2019t tell that funny little Major guy or he\u2019ll want some, and that\u2019d well and truly scupper our Harrods takeover bid, which\u2019d be a real pitv. Major\u2019s loving every minute of it he thinks war\u2019s even more exciting than Trivial Pursuit and doing the washing up, and just as we planned they\u2019ve forgotten all about his poll tax fiasco, our balance of payments deficit and your little Kurdish and Shi\u2019ite problem... Oh, by theway, that nice German pesticide firm wanted me to tell you that they\u2019ve found a new gas formula which works even better than the old one; and Mitterrand says that even if I have to rearrange your air force in the next couple of weeks there are plenty more planes where those came from. Don\u2019t worry, feller, I\u2019ve made sure that it\u2019s business as usual. There\u2019s going to have to be a bit of a turkey shoot, as we agreed - the folks back home are gagging for it - but I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve done as requested and conscripted all the political prisoners and Islamic militants into the front line so we can both kill two birds with one stone, as it were. God knows you don\u2019t want them taking the place over any more than I do. And that brings me on to the bit I know you\u2019re worried about. Of course, we in the Pentagon are absolutely determined to keep you safely at the helm, don\u2019t worry - we never forget our old friends, and your continued presence is essential to maintain the balance of forces with those fundamentalist nutters, as you know.

I thought; why not take their attitude to its log  ical conclusion, and blame Libya for everything that has gone wrong throughout the whole of history? Since then the \u2018Russian Threat\u2019 (featured extensively in some of my earliest poem^)) has evaporated and it looks increasingly as though Arabs and Asians are going to be the West\u2019s new scapegoats (though we\u2019ll still sell them arms and side with them when it suits us, of course, won\u2019t we, Saddam?)
