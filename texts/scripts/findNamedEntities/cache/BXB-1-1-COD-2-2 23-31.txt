Someone has met an eyewitness from Darlington\u2014 A liar, it is true. We had thought this was Only the interruption of one of your stories And you were working slowly on a smoke And, tilting your indoor trilby, would appear Through clouds soon and would broach Your silence waiting like an untouched beer For a man back from the gents. Remember the bloke $k So bent with arthuritis that for his wake They tied him to a board and in the small hours Some joker cut his cords and, with a creak, He sat up grinning? In a digger's jaws Rising in a shroud of snow at bitter daybreak A You cleared a building-site; the mortuary men, Summoned to shift you, dewy, from the road Have brought their breakfasts up and dropped their load When you op4ened an eye. Time and again From under newspaper we fetched you in, A foetal stiff. Around the cup you set Your fingers like a broken basket And thawing your nose in tea began to tell The story of a man from Motherwell Who swallowed three hundred goldfish for a bet And lived. You lived the part: the Indian doctor Offering to amputate; nice Ronnie Kray Visiting his mam; Lord Londonderry Addressing your father like the man next door, ou hooked yourself a stooge when necessary. if the liar from Darlington was right then now The devil is leaning on his fork and you Are keeping him waiting while you toast your bum And roll a smoke for what is still to come ^ \u2014 Ahput a man you met in Eccles who...

Under the wheels, under the crosses of stars stretched out On gaps of darkness they cover themselves and try With a little rod to strike life that will root And long on the sun\u2019s axis to turn securely. Closing in sleep under one mantle, in the ears O f sleep our breathing quieter than a murmur o f sea in shells, We think of them under their draughty lattice of stars And dust going helter-skelter round the stuck poles. 24 y \n￼Swans Not many see the white swans. Vagrants at road-ends have Or, waiting for shift-end, Machine-minders staring At dereliction through the blank panes. Not many hear them. Soiled Drunks have whom the cold wakes Early lying curled; Or, nearly sleeping, the innocent Lovers. After birdsong That is the kindest light. Through silver grey, through rose Across our malignant city The heavy birds strain In this season, about this hour . Little above roof-tops Rapid, whistling, intent, Steadily clouting the air. Pity them should they flag For where is there a meadow Or any habitable water And where, landing or falling, When the day hardens and we Come down the roads will they Avoid our fatal notice? \n￼Watching for Dolphins In the summer months on every crossing to Piraeus One noticed that certain passengers soon rose From seats injt he packed saloon and with serious Looks and no acknowledgement of a common purpose Passed forward through the small door into the bows To watch for dolphins. One saw them lose Every other wish. Even the lovers Turned their desires on the sea, and a fat man Hung with equipment to photograph the occasion Stared like a saint, through sad bi-focals; others, Hopeless themselves, looked to the children for they Would see dolphins if anyone would. Day after day Or on their last opportunity all gazed Undecided whether a flat calm were favourable Or a sea the sun and the wind between them raised To a likeness of dolphins. Were gulls a sign, that fell Screeching from the sky or over.an unremarkable place Sat in a silent school? Every face After its character implored the sea. All, unaccustomed, wanted epiphany, Praying the sky would clang and the abused Aegean Reverberate with cymbal, gong and drum. We could not imagine more prayer, and had they then On the waves, on the climax of our longing come Smiling, snub-nosed, domed like satyrs, oh We should have laughed and lifted the children up , Stranger to stranger, pointing how with a leap They left their element, three or four times, centered On grace, and heavily and warm re-entered, Looping the keel. We should have felt them go \n￼Further and further into the deep parts. But soon We were among the great tankers, under their chains In black water. We had not seen the dolphins But woke, blinking. Eyes cast down With no admission of disappointment the company Dispersed and prepared to land in the city. 27 \n￼/ I ' j \\ 1\u2018- ) 1 / \u201e - ISLANDS 1. Bracken There were sheep then, they pastured on the little islands, We took them there by boat. But the grass has gone And the fold my father\u2019s father built with his bare hands Here at high water has also gone. One by one All his fields have gone under the f^hs again And now it is hard for you to see how it was then. Bitter, unharvested, deeper than children, Theferns risefrom high water over the wall. Thefields drown; the swinging gate isfallen Andferns break round theposts that stand as tall As men. Butfrom the spring you clinibed this way After the spilling water-carts on a hot day. You would not think we had any open ground, But we did. We called it Plains. There was space For all the island to be sitting round Watching the tennis or the cricket. Our playing-place Has gone the way of the fields and I shouldn\u2019t know Where to look for the pitch and the court now. Sunk flourishing in depths o f hitter green The little islands are lost to us already. We watch from boats the rats going hungry between Waste and waste. Rememberfo r our sakes quickly Where the sweet water places were and when And by whom thefields werefirst rid oftheir bracken. Sometimes in summer we made ourselves a bed Under the ferns, where we should never be found, And looked up through the lovely green at the sky and said That we were at the bottom of the sea and drowned. I believe sometimes we slept, but the afternoon When we woke again was still no further gone. 28 \n￼QtcUu -to esOUO Welie ontheharbourwallandpeeringdown Where the wrack heaves and hideous clawsfeel Afterfood, we see the clouds that do not drown In pathless water with all ofour things lost but sail Untouched through the coral and the saltflowers Through the places o f this island that once were ours. / 29 \n￼SS \u2022 ^ Qj 2. At blown cockcrow, hearing the driven sea, You remember the rattling sash, starlight Surviving faintly on the looking-glass And the islands troubled with a ceaseless crying. Scheria, kind to strangers, wept for her ship Sunk by God/unjustly; for the Schiller's More than three hundred souls there were many in Two continents weeping; and everywhere For the sailors of our wars, numberless Mothers\u2019 sons who have rolled in without faces. Indifferent Hermes conducted them all. The sea turns and its creatures hunger. Soon Everything lies under the mercy of day. The surface flickers with scared pilchards. Light, above all the light. And the sea comes, At sunny tide-flow the plucked, the smitten sea Comes running. The wind then, high-ridden by One nonchalant gull, batters the opening Eyes of the sun with water. Far-reaching, Iridescent, the white surf comes and comes. Children are playing under a rainbow On Pool Green; or behind Innisvouls, Delighted in a rocking boat, they stand Out/staring the ancient quizziness of seals. 30 \n￼3. Our child when we came looking and calling after her And had come through marram and sea-holly to the dunes\u2019 crest When we stood crushing in our fingers plucked samphire Looking still further and calling and saw her at last She was remote and small on an almost island And turned away, at tide-flow, but our fear was less Of the sea already parting the cord of sand Than that she was so small and averted from us. We ran heavily, the white sand sank us in, But through the neck of the place stole then like bird-stalkers Over the flat wrack that popped and stank in the sun Towards her kneeling before big granite chairs Gently stroking for shells. When she turned and looked up And showed us wordless in her palm the fissured cowrie The spiralling white horn of wentletrap And scallops smaller than her smallest nail then we With our looks put upon her the fear of death And the ownership of love. Between our tall shadows She walked to the safe beach down the snake path Already sunk over ankles in warm shallows. Gratefully then the weed rose in the sunny water And swirled as it liked and flowed and the bright shell Hoardsfbefore the thrones Sparkled)without her Who stood between us watching, waiting for tide-fall.
