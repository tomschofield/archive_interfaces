Everything green is pouring out of crevices. When I go out the heavy boughs bunch their blossom into tight fists hailing down the mouth of earth. I am asking green to heal me or in some gesture mutely to acknowledge me, but the wind is changing colours back and forth, somehow preserving purity of green, on the top, and on the underside, green closing her throat to my tentative desires. Am I not worth that one sign? e f 13 \n￼Berkeley 11-30 19/8/94 4:43 pm Page Curious George It\u2019s a long day, Thursday, and Curious George looks at it sideways. The sun is hot but the wind blows it all over Crazy Daisy\u2019s field when winter comes and the sky is bitterly blue. Then flocks of hungry waxwings come back to Cirrus Bay. Curious hungry George is watching cloudbanks happening. In a lonely windfilled sky there are no questions; in winter skies the rain comes when the clouds are hard and smooth. Then Curious raindrenched George is quietly glad. All along the ridge on Otis Mountain wind-filled reeds are whistling and bristling flattened, to the east shy Otis Mountain barebacked in the wind, Curious George\u2019s mountain, and he smiles when he hears its name. Trees that are quiet in the sunshine square off a field that belongs to a widowed maid. The rest of the world is wild but the field is sleepy and Curious sleepy George is still, watching the sky. The long day Thursday is nearly ending and all over Pennypies Island a thousand island pines are dressed in many splendid nightblue shadows but Curious shadowswept George is afraid of their trembling boughs, rain will be long days washing the summersoaked mountains, and later on when ice is dry on the windfed reeds Otis Mountain will darkly slumber through sleep in the face of winter and Curious winterwarm George will be smiling again.

With him I walk barefoot on broken glass and swing sideways from the breeze spreading the summer dust. Breakfast with Penn is a shady corner of the day he watches the floating orange peel, I tell him lie Like children do. Penn gets in his car and drives and when the dust has settled it is clear and noon and I am drinking cold liquid by the pool. Can we cross the world by Tuesday? I say it\u2019s hot today. Penn thinks so too. Together, apart, we swallow tastings of the day. They slip down easily. And down the strand on Saturdays the grasses stripe young lovers (we are not watching but our eyes burn anyway) and beach-long waves sift round stories of heartbreak and of calm. It is evening. Penn sleeps. And I become much older with this late shaking of the leaves. I have promised I\u2019ll die easily. Penn says I never miss my cue. Through the gratings of the evening he gets on his bike and rides, and in the small, receding shadows of the day the wheels turn in a loose metal kind of grin. 15 \n￼Berkeley 11-30 19/8/94 4:43 pm Page SS>- Out in the storm This storm explodes while it is still dark. I have no flight to watch my flight from here on up - riding, riding my storm. She blows the sky aside for me to pass and from her back the ground looks faraway. Rainswept. Black. A coiled coastline writhes in a swirl of sea, lightning spills yellow road across the fields. She swoops. Riding storms is fun - she bucks and rears like real horses. Who is old in her timeless gale? She blows a tunnel through the years. Winded words from the doubling trees as she gallops past. Riding storms is easy! Gliding on a tide of rain - oaks are not afraid of rain. Time to bring her home, my storm but reining her is hard. And long after she has bolted to another sky, below me waits the road, yellow in the silence and the oaks are never afraid. Driving storms is fun until they crash. \\/V \u201cTfte R oasts * {b/ittvs poe/v\\?

Walls topple towards me but never fall, and red cars smash green cars again and again, though I scream a warning always slow smashing through the pinhole of a pupil, which will not look away. Rivets do not swivel. So I rhyme to comfort: an odd wish for confidence in metre. I tick, and soon it is no longer I who am bright, who cries out.

It must be close to four by the way the shadows fall and setde. cShould I tap the glass web that shrouds your limbs to plumb the silence of your coming or wait by the chrysalis for your soul to emerge with wet and crumpled wings - a flickering, frightened thing shedding the hours like loose skins while you slip dreamlessly through the layers of day and the wide earth stretches in unbroken song, yawns a sigh to touch your folded limbs, keeping the clouds idly at your sleeping fingertips. At evening when the rain glances off the hours and the shy friends gather in the dark, duty bends me smiling to the earth - your trail blazes nakedly in the open sky, casting your shadow to drag the deep where minnows tremble in their quick flight, yet such a thin slip of life scarcely parts the air and letting me put my two hands into your side you still ask across the aching silence: Now are you full of pride? ^ v** <>\u2022 Berkeley 11-30 19/8/94 4:43 pm Page 19 \n￼Berkeley 11-30 19/8/94 4:43 pm Page 2. In St Etheldreda\u2019s You do that small thing. Know nothing, think nothing, where the unlit stone supports dead prayer of seven centuries massed in drifts against muted glass. The slow beat of awakening consciousness is the one you move to and climbing, memory on memory, remain unsure of the presence, three-personed, whole, which moves to your side after so long, and doubt, and climb back down. In St Etheldreda\u2019s the echoes are prolonged and purple is worn brushing up against the candle flame and you have been close as you will ever be to an admission that the flame, that same flame, burning, is causing you pain. Although you know nothing and may soon stop wanting the reassurance of feeling again, for now, you do that small thing - understanding nothing, believe all, and the certainty is awful, reverential, calm. \n￼Berkeley 11-30 19/8/94 4:46 pm Page 2. Unseen The only blind man in the gallery is missing Whistler, Braque, Matisse; tells me not to try the colours out on such forced memory, but asks instead that I be part of his absurd joy on the street, the open street, because down his mind he sees the tiny soldiers charging - it\u2019s the Light Brigade - and somehow the colours in Still Life on a Man{lfj>iece begin to fade. I have no words for such things anyway. He says the city is forcing her skull through the flesh of streets, lays a finger on the pulse of coming trains (that rumble is the dark grind of suture upon suture) and long before warm air stirs the jointed stick he has heard them cry their sweet whistle along the veins, under his feet the white bone shivers into fissures as he steps quickly in the train to take him home. e t 21 \n￼Berkeley 11-30 19/8/94 4:46 pm Page 2, Coming to I wake from some distant place of dread (is everything spinning sadly out of gear?) but you lie sleeping and I\u2019m sure you dream (how fine to build a house without foundations and coolly scar a treeline with the roof) coiled shyly about the bed. You are a brute, lunging, wondering does he bruise. Sleep drags this admission from your defenceless form, calling me cousin, sister, wife. Over at the easel colours have wrapped themselves on canvas, fierce in the patterns of our dreams, a picture two lives deep. \n￼Berkeley 11-30 19/8/94 4:46 pm Page 2, f The Judas ^1ower When the sun purples the low end of the day he obediendy lights the room. Here is my chance to stroke his hair and touch the soft, round collar-ends. But tonight he is staying very still to separate the restlessness of limbs from the fearful, early stirrings of a sense within; his clear skin so easily fingerprinted by the blundering of my hands, and though I want to ask him for another chance I say instead it is time to end his play. His eyes obliquely roam familiar walls, burning the air in a delicate, suffuse way. My son already knows the cord is cut and tied the liquids of birth long dried. He tries in a childish game to take narrow breaths, restrict the rise and falling of his chest.

The sharp pain was folded there among the scarves and fluttered lightly to the bedroom floor, let fall unseen as I became many childish things before the mirror - Empress, Princess, Queen - the perfect image came of wanting it, of course you would allow me vanity and a little pride. I was thirteen and three-quarters when you died. You, in a crisis, always threw a wide expanse between you and the nightmare visions crossing the horizon, a camel train in a constant desert: there the narrow tunnels, there the great heights. But though you allowed me vanity and that little pride you also threw me from my refuge at your side. Yesterday I sang your song of being no longer dead. I sang, and sang again most loudly in my distress they were three cries to earth each without answer the answer comes from wanting it and I have never stopped wanting so I sang to you instead. 25 \n￼Berkeley 11-30 19/8/94 4:46 pm Page 2, Death in a stranger\u2019s head Four years since you laid your hand on the wicker gate coming with a half-child\u2019s face as close as you dared, looking to me for reason having died in a lover\u2019s head somewhere. And I - I saw a running light and describing it, said it is love without beginning or end, it is the tightest circle round the sun, and you will thrive in the memory of no one. But having died in a stranger\u2019s head you were looking for the moist earth, the silence of burial, and it was not reason saying here was a man, coming unbound to a nub of pain from a lover\u2019s unopened door nor was it reason dictating that you should come to me for more of this troubled shame. Four years since the night I slept, while you were torn apart questioning whether the elements really were air, fire, water, love, earth. And when you came wearily to my bed I felt that you were hot to the bare soles and later I heard you in your sleep. You said no, no. 26 / \n￼Berkeley 11-30 19/8/94 4:46 pm Page 2, Cycling back A sense of your name fills the place. He has left his bicycle quietly weeping in the hall and climbs the stairs: a dead umbrella, dead cigarettes litter the room where he thinks you are. A sense of the recent past spreads its stain on a blank page where the four white letters of your name throw stiff shadows across the day. Your absence sends out feelers along the walls. He is standing, picture-bright, framed in the door. You had filled up every space with so much self that the empty air rusts down in flakes. Your skin smelt of honey and salt and he searched for some meaning to your dreams, sure he could rest in their familiar arms, but they had the aimlessness of wild things, and when he reached out to still the restless, yearning movement of your neck you recoiled in a tight spring; a shower of vibrant, blue triangles sent across the room. He is cycling back to any age, pedalling blindly, dimly aware he cycles away from an empty room where he thought you were. \n￼Berkeley 11-30 19/8/94 4:46 pm Page 2, Oranges The orange colour fills the veins, the orange threads the bones. She glides into the driest of my dreams, that boat with oranges on the canal cleaving the water with her orange laden bows through great June nights. She does not come in little pieces, she is tidal, unified and smooth. You lay your hands on them then - like two round, firm breasts, the orange glowing in the veins. No miracle emerges, only the prickling of skin leaving the flesh of oranges that slip quietly by the banks from Fairways where the meadows bob and the opiate afternoons drip like ice. Someone has found a church, someone else has thrown away a stone as easily cast as chosen, like oranges with their clamorous colour, with their voice - wrung from a supermarket trolley - or picked from the boat where the others bubble to fill the gaps; and the ear is ripe for the water-throb of the engines sensing the barge loom, hideous in night\u2019s gaslight, staid when morning\u2019s feathers settle placidly to noon, and white milk curdles with each of the orange drops. 28 / \n￼Berkeley 11-30 19/8/94 4:46 pm Page 2, Hejira Have you left the silent bed or is a shadow hovering trapped within a life of girders and the grey pools reflecting sins \"I and dimpled with the sleet J on iron, snow-dressed days? 0t/\\d tkY6 Q/ty pools f\u20acf-lectiflg S/VlS di(V\\ple.d Ultt* U/\\&steet W hen the sheet is drawn and you hide, naked, from a bitter reproach, I am rocked, petals blown.

The parting You lower my emotions, sealed in their casket, to the sea bed, knowing I have nothing to say, paring down to presence and absence the sad abstractions of our last day. My throat grows heavy between your hands, my heart gets tossed away. 2 A shadow is working hard against the night, working furiously on a morning wall the shadow cast by fifteen beams of light.

You ran me over with your passion for fast cars. You know, you are only one of the men I know and in my own, shy way, I like them all; you scorched me slightly with your fire-fascination, but I was right to be an empty, earthen cruse when you tried so hard to fill me up with every liquid that I like, and when you want to be a wave come up from the bed all crest and plumage I\u2019ve got to do my best to tip my weight - beaches burst a seam when you froth shorewards, and is it for fun you tilt beneath me?

Even our silent awe sent ripples to the other shore. You discard things as you understand them. After ten years you know well how a whole parcel of your life may be bound tight and put up on a shelf. Memory is a red flower, the best bloom, chosen by you from a drenching of colour on a March street-corner.

You came for Sunday afternoon, you stayed for tea and look what you left behind - every memory, sheafed carelessly on my window seat, of you and someone who looks sadly, sadly, sadly like me. I sometimes think I see you loitering in the shrubbery without intent, idling nonchalantly under the weeping beech; I sent those memories, lovingly enveloped, to that memorable attic flat, someday I may even stand at your door, hopeful and completely uncalled for; but distance is proving such a very thick wall I can hardly hear you any more.

Even taking her leave for school she takes too much; I wish her well, she swallows the wish, a slim match, eating her flame, archly blackening, so I offer her the gift of choice; she chooses lightly with her delicate hands; an hour of silence, poppy seeds, the tale of Ruth, such things. Allowed out on her own, she comes in, wind-blown, arms full of contradictions, laughter about the eyes with their mute agreement of grey and green; she should have been named for a queen, for she loves to presume, she does it with a simple calm, counting mountain peaks among her natural heights.

All my life they brought me, pearl-like, from the waves, and now, well used to handling the names of men long gone from me, and unfamiliar grown, and opening the letters home I do most of my wringing of hands alone. 38 e \n￼Berkeley 31-54 19/8/94 4:55 pm Page 4, Pole-bound Pole-flown, jittering in the sun, you can see me for miles: I am the jubilant one, highflown; my spirits soar and whip, knuckles white, I grip the wind.

I watched the water rise against your dry sides, I saw it suited you to drown, my heart kicked up enough sand to hide itself and lie back still, for you scorn places where the rock-falls make a shallow pool; you held tight to your fraying nerve, you took hold of my words, they came by the roots, as in a time of drought. giving ih- I doA't let go- I saw yoor snooldefs with the h a vjtxjheldtigUttopus i\\et\\Ajyi'duAcj Iaughfng your fcpewovn laugw\u2014 h£ad kenf 10 those 1 wafcked thewater rf;e agai/utyou/d<ys[d^ ' 1 Sawif Jc/itredyou to otfowAj 47 pIuMked -fto/A aA ea/\\yac \n￼Berkeley 31-54 19/8/94 4:55 pm Page 4, W intering O f course I feel you gathering up to leave. In our tightest, briefest arguments I crush nettles with my blind left hand - the child in me peers through a grid of fingers, my eyes are an open wound. Your lies have piranha teeth, freshwater white; the stones of the river grieve until they are worn smooth, and pain has its way with me - a great fish, nosing at my spine. Because I will not try to blunt this helpless, piercing sight, you push me to one side. The cold air salts my face. Perhaps this, too, is a cure, for you are slight and leave no trace. My hand digests the slowest nettle juice, I have no scars to show but I have heard the muttered refrain of wintering tremble up from a flurry of dried leaves at your heel; it goes bury me, I shall grow in spring. e 49 \n￼Berkeley 31-54 19/8/94 4:55 pm Page 5, Convalescent There\u2019s smoke in the air although it\u2019s spring; people are shedding muddy boots and things, slamming their private doors on rooms with sofas and TVs. I fall into the wind - it rights me, mildly, and I walk like a convalescent down a tree-lined path, wood-soothed, thinking of bough and bark and all that will come of the nutshell, the circles in the circles the lathe handles lovingly with its gaze, the hacked limb a lumberman heals with his dab of bright paint.

My dress makes a crimson pendant at the garden\u2019s throat; I swing causing a frivolous shiver of green across the lawn; I am cradled there printing this crescent I wear across the brilliant, livid-sided air. All this swinging stirs the blood, makes whole the filled-up heart, until the garden, stiff in its joints, begins to make fluid the swing to good and the return to wrong \u2014 and when I fall, just let me lie for the more I try to be featherlight the heavier I become and the more I try to be winged and sleepless, the heavier grow my eyes; my senses list to the warp of the earth.
