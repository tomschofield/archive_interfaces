We\u2019ve come to be both audience and show. Mai flicked his lighter, an avalanche roared - we have come to assert everything fits '4^ and we believe the true scale of things is the entire mountain hung mirrored in our shades. # All day snow sank in the billy, was boiled, drunk, peed, replenished as we passed the mountain through us. The chat was home and axes, hopes, seracs. The voices tire, yellow lights hiss as night comes on to very few witnesses but enough. Unblinking stars and lightning - the theatre\u2019s hushed. From the heights we propose to the depths we\u2019ve left our shadows gesture and stretch. 10 \n￼Interlude on Mustagh Tower In these high places we are melting out of all that made us rigid; our ice-screws hang loose on the fixed ropes to the Col. Monday in the Himalaya, the clouds are down, our objective is somewhere, but obscure - let it soar without us for a day! We lounge in thermals on the glacier, brewing and shooting the breeze, that improbable project of conversation among the living. Laughter rings across the ice. Why not? None of us will die today - thafs* immortality you can draw on in a cigarette, harsh and sweet, the way we like it. Steam rises from the billy, Sandy pours. It is true high, worked for, that we pass hand to hand between us with our brews. Men on ice, going nowhere and laughing at everything we cannot see but know is there - among the cloud, on the Col, a hand of some sort is tightening our screws. \n￼Sandy, Topping Out on Mustagh So began to lead the last of the Tower Quite hard more bold than difficult tough ice loose snow but soon brain began to play the game My points investigated stabbed good placements to be had among loose choss Crucified by altitude I bridged a steepish rockwall Good value that I remember everything like ice-slivers in my windsuit\u2019s creases Camp 4 a thousand feet beneath my heels climbing into my shadow the sun flashed off my axe Jon he was somewhere giving good rope and no advice the ideal second but me I was gone Nice work when you can get it the hardest the best hours passed till I wanted a think and a rest so thumped in an ice-screw and hung out awhile - Like I cannot spell, speak porter-talk but who does not who\u2019s lived like me with oil roughnecks and a French girl? One look in her eyes, I know. One straight hit, I find good ice. Climbing's not so much, my life\u2019s more in the way I eat my food, the man I rise above, the roads I drive tofriends, these suit \u2014 Re-engaged myself and winkled on with patient pickers unlocked the crux set my axes well and at full stretch pulled over the top and saw into China 12 \n￼HEAD WAS MUTE o felt ok^felt well (a cheval across the summit) K2 in the distance looking good (suspicion of moisture behind my shades) M ade a belay and took in the ropes as Jon came up. So how\u2019s it going? Oh, wasted, youth... 'From Base Camp to the stream there is a path now and the grass is yellow at the centre o f the path. \u2019 \n￼Entering Askole (for Alalcolm Duff) On the eighth evening vve entered Askole. How can I tell you? We had seen no habitation in two months. Brown dogs twitched in the shade, a chicken screamed; we smelled dung, dall, smoke, lentils; many voices, the bronze fields shone. Lean as schoolmasters, tall wheat rapped our knuckles as we limped into the square. Say there are miracles between where babies twitch and sleep and old folk sleep and totter. Water-mills spun, yaks plonked circles round the threshing floor. Evening prayers, a sleeping miller, tawny goats stole husks of wheat. Goitres hung like apples on the children\u2019s necks. The Hadji lightly touched our backs, Summit good... We had been above ourselves, hooked to pure worlds of black & white & blue, the narrow world of sleeping bags. In Askole we smoked and talked till dawn then rose and crossed the river, paid the porters, jeep did the rest. We broke down, sang \u2018It wall come hard to sleep on beds as soft and wide as ours.\u2019 14 \n￼The Winter Climbing (for A prfi)/ It is late January and at last the snow. I lie back dreaming about Glencoe as fluent, hungry, dressed in red, you climb up and over me. That passion claimed the darkest, useless months for risk and play. You rise up on me, I rise through you... The shadowed face of Aonach Dubh where Mai first took me climbing and as we clanked exhausted, happy, downwards through the dark, I asked \u2018What route was that?\u2019 \u2018Call it what you want - it\u2019s new.\u2019 You reach the top and exit out; from way above, your cry comes down. The rope pulls tight. What shall we call this new thing we\u2019re about? These days we live in taking care and chances. Why name it? My heart is in my mouth as I shout Climbing... 15 ","docTitle":"","docDate":"2014-07-01 08:51:14.267"},"meta":{"contentType":"text/raw","emVer":"7.1.1103.5","langIdVer":"DefaultLangId","processingVer":"CalaisJob01","submissionDate":"2014-07-01 08:51:12.692","submitterCode":"57b17a53-6e34-87b0-20ff-a419896f49c9","signature":"digestalg-1|ME5RSFH9ALsDOEP5Cwj7LIRMFTo=|GcBcAF3YW8/oaj1yoRvygWPk5HlUOR2Z2uA7AKzRhwmJxfyIbozmcQ==","language":"English"}},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/ece47349-4d3a-351a-b7e1-46311b3749c8/cat/1":{"_typeGroup":"topics","category":"http://d.opencalais.com/cat/Calais/Entertainment_Culture","classifierName":"Calais","categoryName":"Entertainment_Culture","score":0.661},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/ece47349-4d3a-351a-b7e1-46311b3749c8/lid/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http://d.opencalais.com/lid/DefaultLangId/English"},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/e911da6b-56e4-3544-9357-5d79d01c1538":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"Position","name":"author","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/Position","instances":[{"detection":"[Poetry Now (BBC Radio 3).<TT*« M aid le i \u2019 v» ]The author[ gratefully acknowledges the help of a Scottish]","prefix":"Poetry Now (BBC Radio 3).<TT*« M aid le i \u2019 v» ","exact":"The author","suffix":" gratefully acknowledges the help of a Scottish","offset":435,"length":10}],"relevance":0.317},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/ba2c727a-fdf7-303e-83ef-4ba0a5fc161d":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"Position","name":"Aide","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/Position","instances":[{"detection":"[Twist-off Bagatelle Dreams In an Italian Field ]Aide[ Memoire The House-Builder Variations Japan]","prefix":"Twist-off Bagatelle Dreams In an Italian Field ","exact":"Aide","suffix":" Memoire The House-Builder Variations Japan","offset":1357,"length":4}],"relevance":0.315},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/31ec6404-85fe-33f5-af02-cb37fec6b170":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"IndustryTerm","name":"oil","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/IndustryTerm","instances":[{"detection":"[but who does not who\u2019s lived like me with ]oil[ roughnecks and a French girl?
