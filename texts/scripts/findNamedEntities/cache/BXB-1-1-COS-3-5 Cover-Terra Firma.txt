Then \"pensively\": I'm truly sorry man's dominion... The audience mesmerised no doubt, as I mimed the cruel coulter, gave the daimen icker laldie. But behind self-mockery, I'm conscious of the duality that revels in revealing feet of clay, yet sups up sentimentality; and hope I toed a line mid-way, purveying an underlying genuineness of feeling. In our world of violence, greed and posturing, never greater need for restating his criterion of goodness: whatever mitigates the woes or increases the happiness of others. Declared hand on chest, or otherwise. / \n￼AYRSHIRE COAST \"Sandy links and raised beaches... made Ayrshire a prime resort for Victorian and later pleasure-seekers.\" [Ayrshire & Arran/RAIS guide] West Kilbride, Gailes, Barassie, Troon, Prestwick, Bellisle and points between: so the links courses of our schooldays unfold like an apron of green baize brooched by gorse and dune, down Ayrshire's coastline. This year's Masters, watched in comfort by satellite, contrasts with that monochrome age, when first prize in the Daily Mail Tournament (all of £250) went to Dai Rees for \"four sturdy rounds\"; his autograph, alongside Henry Cotton's neat hand, a reminder of what we were desperate to emulate - only to learn in life how rather than the dream parabola adolescence yearns for (golf's eguivalent of the perfect iambic pentameter) the ball dips and veers through unsupporting air. Enforced holidays on Troon beach made the most of ice-cream vans lost in enveloping sea-mist; chittery-bites seized on; female underwear seen surreptitiously, as one-piece swimsuits were discarded - paleness of thigh and breast projecting neither guilt nor embarrassment, which in those days seemed not carnal, or remote, but simultaneously peerless and innocent. A different proposition when we danced a decade later, to Harry Margolyes and his Band, at Ayr's Italianate Pavilion Ballroom; and on the prom on autumn evenings, walking arm in arm, glimpsed through fumbled skeins of blonde or auburn, lighthouses blinking from afar; then to return, our numb cheeks flecked with brine. * \n￼Despite erosion, the coastline scarcely changed. Except, where we believed the breakers would always surge purely, squalor has taken over; successive tides jettisoning scum and debris. You can drive on south toward Heads of Ayr, gaze averted to Arran and its Sleeping Warrior. But hard to stomach, the beaches where we sat unfit for a European health certificate. A history not short on brutalities: where Alexander routed Haakon's invaders - Nardinis wicker-chairs and brash torcheres; unmarked graves, and the occasional stone where fleeing Covenanters were hacked down; while in Dunure's black-vaulted dungeon for the Commendator of Crossraguel's basting, Cassilis \"spared not flaming oil\". Confidently claimed Scotland's microcosm, Arran preserves its own social schism: the hotels in Brodick, Lamlash and Whiting Bay part of a douce but rigid hierarchy; coach-parties welcomed by some, not others; guest-houses girt for the Glasgow Fair when the crowds would mill, and glutted gulls followed the churning of great paddle-wheels. Even in this haven, shades of timor mortis: of the glowing Academy girls we rowed, one succumbing early to sclerosis; others performing the offices, for the dead. Amongst summer's specialties meanwhile persists the democracy of the bicycle; with rucksacked cohorts setting out to tackle the rock-chimney of Glen Sannox, and Goat Fell. * / \n￼The Season ending, B&B signs come down; the daily ritual of the sheets ceases; skimpy guest-towels are returned to store. Arcades of fruit-machines empty. Vacated caravan sites reveal their own mal du pays. More grave the varieties of silence, year round, where diverse activities once were: boat-building in harbours made derelict; factory work-forces hit by the rigours of redundancy. To freewheel down (or up) the Electric Brae an ideal metaphor for the economy; Culzean's castellations, provenance of the rich; and on the skyline, defunct Ailsa Craig, Cuchulain's curling-stone. In a county of milk-yielding heifers, creameries producing ersatz cheeses; lace curtains still gracing Newmilns and Darvel - but their heyday undone by cheap labour from Japan. Pit closures, dignity once attained at the coalface; rails rusting from Doon to Dalmellington: Cockburn's \"last place in Ayrshire where with a good deal of primitive manufacture, rural simplicity and contentment linger\" - its Age of Iron having come and gone... Whisky aside, the one sacrosanct industry centres on Alloway. Burns statues scan a World which while paying lip-service, reveals less and less his philosophy of brotherhood, than Man's inhumanity to Man. \n￼TROON REVISITED Never a swimmer, my dominant memory of Troon beach is of a toe half-severed by broken glass, the painful hirple to the house. At this remove even, I tread gingerly. Constants: the spire of St. Meddan's, Marr's copper dome; tankers that seem moored since last time. Less propitious: peeling bungalows, grimy dunes netted against erosion, engendering insecurity, gentility going to seed. Sensing an epoch gone, I recall the zigzag from tee to green when as schoolboys we tackled Fullarton, then cycled to savour Togs's famed ice-cream. Concession too, of disillusion within a personal littoral. The harbour shrunken, the Ballast Bank less precipitous: accomplices to further self-perception - as with a mountain cairn, its attainment once a measure of achievement, now found to be no more than knee-high, Lilliputian. \n￼EARLY DAYS Connections Changing trains at Glasgow Central, en route for a poetry workshop in Kilmarnock, I visit the bookstall which has, needless to say, none of my volumes on display. Nor any sign on the departures board of my connection, I'm so early. Eventually it appears: objective reality restored, at least. Soon the old litany: Dunlop, Stewarton, Kilmaurs... As my fellow-travellers, secure in their identities or otherwise, journey on towards Sanguhar, Carlisle, my reception counters expectation: a strummed guitar; the car in a tarmacked space where rails once were, set in cobbles, to ease the dray-horses' burden. To an unaccustomed music, and hyacinths in bloom, the decades dissolve, and we coast into town. School motto Among my memories: a smell of modelling clay (this before coloured Plasticine); rows of Mickey Mouse gas-masks (placing me in the early 40's); and school caps, regularly floating like rowan berries down the Kilmarnock water. Our infants mistress, Annie C. MacLarty, FEIS, took us to her ample bosom \n￼before handing us over to Davy Gordon, who ruled with a rod of iron. In senior school we were further matured by two breakdowns and a suicide. Later our French master went into mourning, when a colleague's son got only a third at Aberdeen. By then, we others had gone our own way: unshriven, but trying (some of us) to do justly, love mercy, and walk humbly... New Farm Loch We skated here after school, breath visible in the frosty air, chestnuts sizzling, the ice ringing. Or played football, blazers for goals; Tom Campbell ghosting down the wing; others less skilled, picked as a cock or a hen. Drained long since, the loch's declivity holds a housing estate. Yet I sense presences blowing on their fingers as if all these years later, my schooldays were pursuing me through acres of trees \n￼no longer there. The one tangible reminder: a hole in my left knee, where the heel of a skate sank in. Mirror image Evening drawing in, I revisit old haunts: the Burns monument, smaller than I recall; St Marnock's, its trees sguat as ever; and facing the Dick Institute the sandstone Academy, dominant on its hill. Over a couple of pints in the Goldberry I'm told I don't sound like I'm really from Killie; the intervening years having added an overlay. But things seem to go smoothly. So that by the time I'm back at the station, I'm confident I could pass for local. Till reflected in the waiting-room window, I see a familiar figure carrying a plastic bag emblazoned, \"Ayrshire and the Burns country\" \n￼PEACE AND PLENTY On autumnal Saturdays we'd cycle to Caprington Estate with its great chestnut trees: the lawns littered, each spiky bur split on impact, ripeness preserved intact. Pockets filled, we hurled up sticks to dislodge what more we could - part of our pleasure, an eagerness to get at the upper class with their stately homes and shiny Daimlers, the only way we knew. Ingrained, a callow awareness of revolutionary days, eggs thrown at carriages, aristos done down. Natural to take sides. Only later, their crumbling mansions seen as bombastic parodies of what they'd set out to be; inherited middle-classness recognised for the encumbrance it was, cocooning rather than aligning us with miners' families, or those in the row of neat cottages called Peace and Plenty: the name implying a comfort counter to hardship undergone - harking back to an age of emergent patronage, presaging a New Dawn. Hard to take, the fruits of promise not justice but a polarisation of wealth such as we've seen; a retributive Government seeking scapegoats amongst Society's weakest; stooping to enlist folk-myth in ways we never dreamt of. \n￼TERRA FIRMA The church of which my father was minister lowered over my boyhood, its front elevation imprinted on the retina; an endowed carillon spendthrift expenditure of a sum more practical if put towards the maintenance of rotting roof timbers and friable sandstone. Although latterly dwarfed by the Police Station and Sheriff Court opposite, an architectural survey recently lauded its structure from hood-moulded main door to battlemented tower, not to mention the pulpit's fine expression of the crescendo of the Gothic revival... We'd never have guessed (far less cared) when as children we fidgeted on hard pews, that those encompassing walls in future years would be praised as scholarly perpendicular - a paradox sharpened by the then snobbery of the town's more class-conscious clergy one of whom murmured, after his ordination, \"Of course St Marnock's isn't on the map, Conn\". Throughout his calling, in ways I was then too young to comprehend, he remained his own man: voicing concern for single mothers, whom the Kirk's committees saw as \"fallen women\"; and believing an unfashionable ecumenicalism the way to enlightenment, debating at Coodham and courting the Kilmarnock Standard's abuse by counting among his friends, RC priests. As through a glass darkly, I have come to a more comprehending admiration for the industry and integrity he must have channelled into his ministry - rather than any inheriting of beliefs: partly because he never exerted pressure but permitted me to go my own way, doubtless praying it would not be to purgatory.
