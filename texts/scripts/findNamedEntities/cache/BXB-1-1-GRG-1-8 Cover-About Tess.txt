Be arrogant: we animate this wilderness. Mai flicked his lighter, an avalanche roared - we have come to assert everything fits; the entire mountain hangs mirrored in our shades. All day snow sank in the billy, was boiled, drunk, peed, replenished as we passed the mountain through us night unfolded in the presence of witnesses; unblinking stars and lightning - the darkness is lit from a depth we can rely on. \n￼THREE ABOVE IAMCHE BAZAAR Sandy, feeling somewhat queasy, squatted above lamche, shat a foot-long worm. My life's like that, he said as we laughed and took our photographs, a thread of consistency through unpredictable shit - all things pass as expeditions through the Bazaar, joking & jiving & ripping each other off. Got a bad feeling about this trip, boss. Some days you scoff and scoff but just get thinner, Mai grinned. Had a friend, now dead, wha'd swallow a lil' tape-warm before he came out here - never got ill. Believe it, just to be here, we musta been promoted. We rounded the corner^ ______there \u2014 big Mothers: Ruptse, Lhatse, Everest.

Hey wasted youth so how's it going? -\u2018From Base Camp to the stream there is a path now \n￼EITEEIJTG ASKOLE (for Malcolm Duff) On the eighth evening we entered Askole. How can I tell you? We had seen no habitation in two months. Brown dogs twitched in the shade, a chicken screamed, we smelled dung, dall, smoke, lentils. Many voices, the bronze fields shone. Lean as schoolmasters, tall wheat rapped our knuckles as we limped into the square. Say there are miracles between where babies twitch and sleep and old folk sleep and totter. Water-mills spun, yaks plunked circles round the threshing floor. Evening prayers, a sleeping miller, tawny goats stole husks of wheat. Goitres hung like apples on the children's necks. Hadji lightly touched our backs, Salaam ... We had been above ourselves, hooked to pure worlds of black & white & blue, the narrow world of sleeping bags. We sat till dawn, smoking, waiting on something; rose and crossed the river, found our porters, jeep did the rest. We broke down, sang 'It will come hard to sleep on beds as soft and wide as ours.' \n￼AFTER EVEREST Between one expedition and the next we buried the tiny Buddha's bones upright, with respect, at the bottom of the garden. Then we were driven back to the mountain. Between the highway and the ditch the restless West verges at its limit - no one said we are too old to die young, too young to retire as we left Lhasa in dust. \n￼CRUX Delicate, hell-cat, at the crux on Hoy, last ward in day-long converse with rock above deep blue, climbing into pale blue, aiming for grace. A hard way to be normal. Mental technics took him far, 800 feet, soloing and high on that mug's game. low our chancer's fingers stutter below the bulge - he's run out of ways to speak to sandstone. Gripped? Mummified. The rock is smooth as political tongues. Hung from a hand-jam, rock crystals enquire of his skin*. How much you wanna live, \\ Some questions draw blood and pride equally, he answers, smears his right foot, gets his left edged high. Chalk-bag, pinch-grip ... He's kiltered out, all trussed up and nowhere to go. The world waits with casual interest. Gooseflesh. sonnythis draught blowing through from the next world - going there soon? Adhesion's mostly faith for intricate movers but he's shivering agnostic now slipping the hand-jam stretching his right boot slips right hand up fast as a prayer grabs his Grail o lovely jug cranks like a maniac over the bulge ... Thugged it to the top, sat and was blank, was gone, was everywhere in Orkney longlight. We met him in Stromness, it was etched in his eyes he'd dipped deep into more than his chalk-bag that day. White as cocaine his fingers drummed the bar, awaiting tequila; -Been pushing the envelope, matey? His eyes were schist as he considered our question, glinting and flakey his smile: Yeah, licked the stamp too. Revving kite on taut string, could plummet or soar - delicate hell-cat, you'll do. \n￼AVALAICHE He's at it again; first time in years a woman's hips hands eyes, wherever the categorical resides, have issued the imperative Screw our lights out. Hot bulb! (Cooling in the dark.) He dreams of an avalanche casual as breathing ... Swathed in white sheets he regards her where she lies face down. The terror lies in the tenderness derived between the slope and shiftings of her ribs. \n￼GULF ABOUT TESS TESS, IB TUNISIA STILL MAGGIE SAYS 'NOCH ANNIE, VISITING ANNIE, IN SPRING K^x yx.x« *** xx^xvx,wwx, FISHING D., IN A CHECKED SHIRT D.,RIDING TREATY AVALANCHE SCREWED SORBETS & OTHERS \n￼GULF Sothing is missing, said she on White Wisp, the world turns and we turn with it, not losing touch. I'll always love you and but In the Gulf a destroyer lowered its defensive screen for a chat - men were blown away. Sorry pal, we didn't mean ... The plane flew back to base in some confusion; soon she did too. Men yearn, metal gapes, verses implode memory and daily news. Between I & I the holy wars elide; between us flew lovely, misguided, direct, words like love, like Exacet. f \n￼ABOUT TESS You draw smoke down your throat; the rasp which says you're not dead yet is the trigger of seductions. 'Do you ever', she asks, 'act on irresolution?' The bar is melting at the edges. You colonize each other as the folkies sing of Nicaragua - in such moments you may find incandescence in amnesia. 'Alright,' one hand on hers, the other round your car keys, 'Why not?' There are reasons but they melt. You'll find them in the morning by the bed in pools of stiffened candlewax. Relax. Tonight you will not cross the border. You cast huge shadows as you get into the car. / ","docTitle":"","docDate":"2014-07-01 09:51:58.548"},"meta":{"contentType":"text/raw","emVer":"7.1.1103.5","langIdVer":"DefaultLangId","processingVer":"CalaisJob01","submissionDate":"2014-07-01 09:51:56.941","submitterCode":"57b17a53-6e34-87b0-20ff-a419896f49c9","signature":"digestalg-1|I1mVXsJZHxbgUu+/YCWcZMOmhLw=|QkYlZTI3Y6h+CFvhrfCpn1hK2jh9Dl+CchVTQLSJLlvbd9zpiPXFww==","language":"English"}},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/3b732876-423a-386e-aa6c-09509c48ff57/cat/1":{"_typeGroup":"topics","category":"http://d.opencalais.com/cat/Calais/Hospitality_Recreation","classifierName":"Calais","categoryName":"Hospitality_Recreation","score":0.852},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/3b732876-423a-386e-aa6c-09509c48ff57/lid/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http://d.opencalais.com/lid/DefaultLangId/English"},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/f0de9606-a91f-3290-8e58-29c0b3c3aeab":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"IndustryTerm","name":"metal","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/IndustryTerm","instances":[{"detection":"[in some confusion; soon she did too.
