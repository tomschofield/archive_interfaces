Haughty, you take your seat; your arm shrinks from his hand; I whisper into your ear, I am still crazy for you. He is still crazy for you. He watches you, late, uncombed, with lateness on your mind straight from your doctor\u2019s room, enter the cinema\u2019s dark afternoon, sit straight by him. Neither yet flickers a sign. You brush your hair from your eyes. Mink is as tender as steel in alphaville. Hair is as molten as steel in alphaville. He watches you watching the screen W ith never a glance at him. He watches him loving you, je t\u2019aime je t\u2019aime je t\u2019aime he whispers, now as then. He is still crazy for you. Your hands touch on the sheet, like pack-ice, split again. Days are as cool as steel in alphaville. Love is a cutting-room, all images equally true, I mix them all up in you, au revoir becomes je t\u2019aime in the crystal at your ear, as I direct your hand to stretch for husband, lover; the camera is crazy for you. A film can be cut like steel in alphaville. \n￼Your hands in the pit of your back, steel grapples to eyes of steel; your breasts on hoardings star; swiftly you brush your hair; your husband is crazy for you. Our son must be fetched from school. Blinds of the late afternoon are falling one by one. Light opens on the steel evening of alphaville. You are the bathroom-scale\u2019s bland mutability; the steel tape whips around your breasts, your waist, your thighs, imexorably as lovers; the tape is crazy for you, erecting your rasped nipples; it hugs you into despair. You ghost into the steel slimlines of alphaville. When, next autumn, next spring, the houselights go down on this film, who will be crazy for you, whisperingjet'aime je t\u2019aime? I whisper this in your ear: stretch out your hand to him, but remember our mountain-cabin; preserve it in snow of your tear; converse on what is real in alphaville. You are light falling on breasts, you are a stocking\u2019s stretch, you are the heel of a shoe, you are a brush through hair, you are a collar turned up, you are the leaves you crunch, you are the wheel of a car, life is in love with you; you are the sad, steel thrill that steals through alphaville. \n￼'> \u2019 ' 'V ' V.* , ,v,;. ■ -S-.-.V \u2022■wwwr ","docTitle":"","docDate":"2014-07-01 09:57:03.501"},"meta":{"contentType":"text/raw","emVer":"7.1.1103.5","langIdVer":"DefaultLangId","processingVer":"CalaisJob01","submissionDate":"2014-07-01 09:57:02.175","submitterCode":"57b17a53-6e34-87b0-20ff-a419896f49c9","signature":"digestalg-1|W67aI1n4ti3Z1FO9RArzLWu/mIg=|CBPioGo18AP81WAxUEx4iGlCJ1uNUwgMOhrSHX9hRqtTbO96qxRK/A==","language":"English"}},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/f6df444a-309f-3429-aef2-0ca4027a8a75/cat/1":{"_typeGroup":"topics","category":"http://d.opencalais.com/cat/Calais/HumanInterest","classifierName":"Calais","categoryName":"Human Interest","score":0.884},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/f6df444a-309f-3429-aef2-0ca4027a8a75/lid/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http://d.opencalais.com/lid/DefaultLangId/English"},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/4208de29-ea70-3a0f-8da4-f05d8fcb71be":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"IndustryTerm","name":"steel slimlines","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/IndustryTerm","instances":[{"detection":"[it hugs you into despair.
