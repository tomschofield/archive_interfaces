( Lt>Vv«\u2019 1. i^fPrologue:The Children ' I bade them climb: they must have come to the very crest And it was beautiful to see them shine Not steadily but charged at a sudden moment And for only such duration as the light allowed The light they caught upon their faces from the face Already we should have thought sunk out of sight. There are some dead we see and even see by; They glimmer for a generation, our looking Lends them more luminance. I saw the father, Whom no-one can rekindle, appear to shine Over the earth in the eyes of the gazing children/ They cast his face upon my white paper. ^ 2% # vrcJLo ------ 2.tl] After how many Novembers ... i o j t f [cpu, In Memorjam ^57d-JPrivate J.W. G1eave who was at Montauban, Trones Wood and Guillemont How soon, I wonder, after how many Novembers 7 □ Did the years begin to seem not paces Interminably around a pit nor steps deserting -■^QA place, but slow degrees by which she came Over the curve of the world into that hemisphere Q His face rose in? Again we have given ground, The dark advances an hour into the afternoon, Q In the interlude between cloud and horizon A mild sun scythes the field\u2014 so by the last winter Q After an illness and before her death We saw a similar light dawn on the woman Q Who had been a widow more than fifty years. lMVUtrtv> IP * 10' \n￼She lingered in the doorway of the living-room □ Impelled as people leaving are to Some word more than goodnight. I □ Bright as a young girl\u2019s on that threshold Bright with tears. She found nothing to say. But having ClHer purse in hand\u2014 the purse she had kept house from For generations since the Queen died\u2014 she took out Q The new, neat, folded notes of her pension And to the children and their children and their child Q Disposed of these. We do not like to watch A person look for words nor by whatever gestures Q Taking her leave of table, hearth and chair. She went to her own room where everything was ready □ To leave, the furniture of her married life Though in another house, one he had never seen. □ But in that mirror he had seen his face, They will have stood side by side and looked at themselves □ She will have stood by herself and remembered. And always she held the two or three photographs QWhich light had fallen on man and wife to make In an envelope with the notice of his death □ A s if to cross over with these in hand That she should know him again who had been effaced QAnd he should know her who had lived and aged. \\ ; 3.Q Notification,&m T It was the painful duty of Lieutenant Thomas Dinsdale On Army Form B 104-82 In an envelope the postwoman shrank from touching To notify my grandmother of her altered state. The women stood by, they followed the post like crows: To whom would such a communication come That morning, to what woman by the hand of a woman Whose job it was daily to visit that village of streets And lay the stigmata on certain doors? iu \n￼So the news came from Guillemont to Salford 5 After a lapse of weeks during which time She had known no better than to believe herself a wife. Not having seen him die and when Upon their notification nothing followed Neither the body to her hearth Nor any of the late soldier\u2019s effects A little while As though the outcome could be put in doubt She trimmed her mourning with a thread of hope She kept the Suitor from her husband\u2019s chair Showed Death the door Nightly, until the evenings were long. He called then with a companion from France. The neighbours, who miss nothing, saw Only the soldier leave. No messenger in the tragedies So mean but coming to the wife, the mother Or any beloved woman waiting Recounts fittingly the dead man\u2019s death In alexandrines or iambics And honours him in the telling. But who the pal was is not remembered Nor what he said, nor what the questions were She had the heart to put nor whether She lamented there and then, praising the qualities O f the man lost and hiding her face as queens do In her apron. Not a word, not the place itself Reached me in his pronunciation But as to how and where \n￼She only shrugged her shoulders And perhaps she had that from the messenger Who did not tell her that the night was very short And began in a barrage of phosgene gas And ended in a thick fog And a barrage of high explosive As they moved around the southern edge of Trones Wood Across seven hundred yards of open ground Gently sloping to the village of Guillemont In an attack understood to be hopeless But serving the French on their right Whose attack was also hopeless And that somewhere before the wire He was obliterated In gas and night and fog. 0 *1 \u2014- 6. But by November the congregation of widows Q Being told it was a reasonable sacrifice Their men had made saw mutilated trees bedecked QWith bloody tatters and being nonetheless Promised a resurrection of the body □ They saw God making their men anew out of The very clay. These women having heard from soldiers Q However little from the battlefield Towards All Saints gathered black gouts from the elder QAmong their children stared at the holy tree And envied Christ his hurts fit to appear in.

JcK\\ kfi There being no grave, there being not even one Ranked among millions somewhere in France, Her grief went without where to lay its head. She would have rested sooner had she had Or had she even learned somewhere there was A well-kept place where he was lying dead. ■4t She could not even think him out of harm: He must be hurt somewhere by every shell, Somewhere his mouth could not get breath for gas. She would have scavenged all his body home Into the shelter of if not her house At least the roofed and hidden well-walled grave. But of what comfort is the body home Which here or there cannot embrace or smile? And of what comfort is the body whole? Only the rich and saints do not corrupt. She almost thought there were degrees of death And he was more dead piecemeal and abroad. There being nowhere but the family grave She went and called her grief out of the air And coaxed it to alight upon the stone That did not bear his name. Upon that absence She grieved as though it were the greater one And death was lured almost within her view. Sne set that feature on the featureless Visibly everlasting plain of death She trod a path, she made some little inroad And placing three or four remembrance days She netted in their few interstices Glimpses that she could bear out of the deep. fu4 \\ \n￼*r 8.Q Roll of Honour CM _ She never saw his name at Thiepval Nor even in Manchester Cathedral But on Liverpool Street outside the Mission Hall There was a Roll of Honour on the wall 4 Affixed in nineteen-seventeen And this she will have seen Daily (until the Blitz Blew all the names to bits). he enlisted men\u2014 there were no officers\u2014 Were columned street by street and hers Was one of those already crossed.
