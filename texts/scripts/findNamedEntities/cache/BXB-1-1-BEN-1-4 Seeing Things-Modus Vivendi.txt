I make a decorous turn in the deeper water, and something catches my eye far below. A child-like figure is spreadeagled at the bottom of the pool. I try to scream, but water fills my mouth. The figure drifts, in slow motion, towards the side - I follow dumb with fear, heart knocking, ready to grasp at hair, at limbs: it blooms upwards, growing like magic and comes out of the water as a burly, bearded man, who heaves himself up the steps, checks his watch, and turns, placidly, towards the high board. / \n￼HISTORY va-.^ \u2014_\u2014' ^l^fyTVS Some changes come so slowly: nothing happens, yet something is happening & The boy is on a slow dissolve into youth. The creeper covers the pergola though you sat under it for days and not a leaf moved. A Her heart cools to you perhaps but when did this begin - % was it that day when her gaze strayed to someone for a moment; or when she first moved her hand away, like this? Fun \n￼in \n￼IF YOU COME ft H- 4 The birds come to feed me. Yesterday one brought bread and today I have a nut, a snail and a berry, red as your mouth. & Moving air sighs in the eaves: La belle indifference I hear, as nightfall robs the trees of a dimension. % Messages, of course, I disseminate freely: one behind the clock, one in the knife drawer, one into my letterbox - an oubliette in its own right. 4- If you come, take the aerial route, alighting near the embankment where the backless cupboards and bony umbrellas are all pierced through with heartsease and dock, branches strive through the brickwork and the paving is grouted with moss. \n￼IN THE SUMMERHOUSE 4r^r^ > In the sumerhouse you cannot hear your children crying. 4 Plaintive sounds fan out fran the far windows 4r and dissipate into the canopy of trees. Everything loosens in the heat, petals, buds, muslin. Hands unpin your hair__ now you hear nothing, but the tick of a watch. Tis\\ \n￼i \\ THE LAST GREAT FOG The fog came down at four, thick and impassive at the windows, and suddenly the office was an island. You walked me home through this strangeness. The buses had given up. An occasional car faltered along the road, its lights describing swirling cylinders of nothingness. The fog set us free. We laughed at everything We were abroad, unattached, in lunatic spirits we clung, falling about on kerbstones. You pulled me inside your overcoat and the tweed tasted of fog. The next day dawned bathetically fine. You worked without remission at your desk and I at mine. \n￼PUZZLE PICTURE '2>c>^T^( Hereisapuzzlepicture. Itisagarden: flowers, ferns, a tree, a bush. In it are hidden a roan, a woman and a child. 4 The artist is so cunning with his brush. Is that a woman up there in the tree or merely a strange configuration of the boughs? 4 Perhaps she is gazing down through the lush foliage, to where a man's hand seems to be touching a freckled knee, 4 or can she see two figures lying oddlyintertwined; plaitstiedinribbonbows, a smiling mouth half hidden by a leaf? 4 One thing is certain, somebody is crying. Tears fall from the tree into the quivering ferns. We cannot call it rain - unless rain bums. \n￼I think I know where I am. A rumbling train shivers the ants in the grass, a branch shifts and groans, my cheek is creased by a rug of folded hills. I cannot make my eyes open. Someone may be near me. A voice cries 'havoc' - but who would use such a word? My heart knocks - the only part of me which can move. A doll I had once would not open her eyes; her blind lids were shellac pink and blank as insolence. We punished and punished her. In the silver distance glasses ring with laughter. Music spools out of a window and is pulled back in again. I concentrate my will - prise open a crack of light which falls on the yolk of a daisy, on the mountainous pores of my arm, on a gargantuan hand which flexes itself in the grass. 1001 \n￼LOST BELONGINGS The preamble was brilliantly put together: the downland path leading to the horizon under fresh snow; a spaniel running back to us with a stick. We bend towards him, and as we walk on you take my hand in yours. A close-up shows my shocked delight. But the face is strangely unlike my own. We are seen growing closer. The theatre seats at your own play; my friends becoming envious; the first kiss, in that shadowy room with the blue chairs. We seem set for a life of bliss and press coverage until I awake from this grotesque miscasting, cooling down from euphoria to my real self. It must have been someone else's dream drifting in the ether, attaching itself to the wrong night's sleep - like a video from the wrong box, viewed by mistake but with serendipitous delight. Ho / \n￼MODUS VIVENDI _ Each night, as he played patience she stood behind his shoulder. 4c Hack on Queen,^ she would cry just before he spotted it himself. How was it, then, that she murdered him rather than the reverse? * Some games have rules which are the very devil to understand.
