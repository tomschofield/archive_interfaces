Perhaps William made it mentionable for listeners later on.\u2019 \u2018And how did such a garment happen to be lying on top of the snow in that casual fashion?\u2019 \u2018I heard Eliza tied whatever the red thing was to the end of a branch, poked it up through the drift.\u2019 \u2018Which would need a convenient seven-foot pole, considerable strength and functioning, even dextrous, fingers! Then envisage the removal of that petticoat or drawers from legs that had long gone dead under several thick skirts and the folds of a mantle, with again the problematical-because-frozen hands.\u2019 \u2018It was the purest accident. Sounding ahead with his stick, like any wise walker in such a snowed-under, featureless landscape, he felt the ashplant sink too deep; and at last someone heard a cry - though now it was much fainter than before - from what for eight days had been a lump or a bank or a flat place of hollow snow.\u2019 \u2018Just because your account is the last of a list, don\u2019t think it will be the definitive version. It won\u2019t, you know. It\u2019s only another story.\u2019 \u2018And so they dug her out and carried her - making a chair of their hands, since they feared to unlock her yet from that sitting posture - to her home and her circling children, to warm broth between the lips, and a six^months career as some sort of wonder of the world.\u2019 ^ 32 \n￼Austin 9-34 10/2/93 4:59 pm Page 33 4. Sunday 10th February to Wednesday 24th July 1799 \u2018Why did so many come to hear her story?\u2019 \u2018Why are we here now, trying to thrash it out?\u2019 \u2018But to pay up to a day\u2019s wages to sit beside her ripe-smelling rumpled bed with the ale jug next to it, to watch those hands that were like the naked blackened paws of an unknown animal; just to hear from her own lips the variable stories - memory laced with drink and imagination, or fancy lightly pricked with recollection.\u2019 \u2018From her own lips. To say^1 was there x and personally heard her memories/ v To say'T felt the weight and stiffness y of those hands, I helped her to a drink, and she told me what she had never revealed before/Here something like the meteor would come in.\u2019 * \u2018Needing the mystery and wonder. Needing to believe life is stronger than death after all; that an ordinary woman buried longer than Christ, could rise and live on to lie in relative comfort, attended by her children, drinking as much as she liked.\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t believe it was Lizzie who changed the versions. You know how these legends grow, passed as it were from hand to hand, embroidery added where there\u2019s plainness, the listener\u2019s own explanations put in where the cause of an effect seems lacking. Suppose Elizabeth Woodcock wanted to bear witness, tell the details of her fate as clearly as she could; do you think anyone would have let her leave it unvarnished, plus the dark gaps come from sleeping or the failure of memory? They must add their decoration every time.

Drink was a delightful blurring: every colour into mixture, every minute joining others till thought of the snowcave snowcase brought with it befores and afters - no nightmare, part of history, just life.\u2019 \u2018So the drink was what she died of in the end.\u2019 \u2018In July. Her husband gone almost at once, and no money found behind him in the house.\u2019 \u2018And a stone put up to mark the ground where Lizzie had sat in the womb or nutshell, like the kernel or waiting child.\u2019 \u2018Then the stone was moved to a more convenient spot, and the plough no longer took account of Bet Woodcock\u2019s particular place in that field.\u2019 34 \n￼Against the Gentle Vanishing. ...these words for a wall, a dam where the waters build but do not overflow, for lock gates shut on the well of detail; but the fullness of time is a wave that must come in. These words for a net instead, fine-meshed as muslin, to fish up the dead turn of head, the swallowed voice. I felt the pattern and play of bones under the still-fine fur: the point on his skull between the ears, the jerky steep steps of his spine, the neat rectangular box of pelvis, peak of breastbone and so on; muscles gone thin as silk - only furred skin to hold the skeleton, to shape the cat. The eyes dreamed wide and did not see the cushion or my hand but something through and past them, whatever it was as still as a pool in peat. I was moved by his gaze, its range and bigness. And the audible breath, and the visible jumping heart. When the needle came to touch and meet that heart his cry was outraged, and those eyes caught an unseen object flung fast towards them. Then the fur lay still and flat on a bag of bones. This net fishes the shed claw from the floor, the ball of greyed hair from underneath the sofaf his seated shadow caught in the window\u2019s rectangle...
