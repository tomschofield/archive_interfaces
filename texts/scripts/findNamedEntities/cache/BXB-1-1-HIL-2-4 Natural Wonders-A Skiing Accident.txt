His mother sends a new suit every year. \u2018He only cares about his mathematics.\u2019 ii He\u2019s tired. He hates the snow. He can\u2019t stop masturbating. Each little death, each floating point cries Heaven, where are you nou/f iii The handsome mountain-dwelling monk lies dead. Something is wrong with the electric fan. His secret love-affair exceeds his wildest dreams, while here on earth the other monks are lapsing. Note: In the technical term \u2018decimal floating point\u2019, the sequence 2658 13, for example, would be used to represent the number 2.658 x io 13, or 26580000000000. \n￼Lotty A white South African depressive is kneeling on the veldt in Waterberg training the beam of an electric torch onto a little garden, where a king and queen in white are watering their fungi-beds. Baby soldiers wriggle on the paths, and lift their heads from time to time to suck the lovely globules forming on the queen\u2019s black jaws . . . He kneels by the nursery all night. It\u2019s true he isn\u2019t well. His wife died, and he lived alone with Tame Toktokkie X and Tame Toktokkie Y. His six-inch mother scorpion, who carried sixteen babies on her back in pairs, died recently as well. He used to call her Lotty, or Carlotta, his mother\u2019s and his grandmother\u2019s name, \n￼Lucy They lie down naked in the spider room where legs are ears. They listen as they spin. Then Lucy takes him for a walk. My dear, in half an hour, she is in love with him. Ulrike Meinhof, sing angelically; Mongol invaders, bathe in padded light; it is the Buddha passing on his elephant. Lucy, take your love and follow him. Benjamin I am so close I could kiss you, Benjamin. (Our eyes never meet.) Do you remember slicing shins like fruit? Do you remember stepping through the snow with nothing on? (I\u2019m pulling off your jeans. I\u2019m very close.) You dance and hide and live on peas like necklaces. (She wishes you would smile, but you don\u2019t.) You\u2019re sleeping on the floor beside your ra where crow-black songs revolve, revolve, revolve. (Your mummy thinks you are a sort of ghost.) \n￼A Skiving Accident Even the humble mole dreams while he sleeps, a little man as clean as a tomato. Lives in hills, dreaming of a beetle coming \u2019 The presidents dream of the presidents, breaking their hearts on the piste. Pineapple Lip Balm. Blood on her mitts.
