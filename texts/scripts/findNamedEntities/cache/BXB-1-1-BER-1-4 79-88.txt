The bus groans as though in pain against livid barriers; prevailing winds fold their gags into my mouth, the land lies north to south her waters turn to follow the moon, the cold lies flat along the ground, frosts calm the earth\u2019s trouble, she is black and white from pole to pole, the great whites, north and south, the snow wastes and ice caps, and then the deeper blacks where space roars, way beyond, as though out there all darkness found a voice.

I have lost hunger. My space contracts, I always escaped before. Down at the shore the sand is running out. Infinite hunger yearns at the rim of the worlc^ - Famine gnaws my bones; 0 hunger is the core beneath the film of mist and the comfort of men; their raw god, the one they ring bells for. e 75 \n￼Berkeley 55-96 19/8/94 5:05 pm Page 8, Airport We split seconds as the engines climbed to drown the time. On tiled floors your bags no longer looked like yours and distance telescoped, ' e giddy surface was too sheer for us. 3 keep a footing on the rolling earth I played a game of missing you ahead of time, you played this too, I heard you turning over in your mind shots of the things you left, brought to light, in the red room behind your eyes. The wheels began to scream there wasn\u2019t enough oxygen I saw you lean in to the heavy swell and hope to swim across the tarmac to the white machine and flounder in. \n￼Berkeley 55-96 19/8/94 5:05 pm Page 8, Reflex She crouched in the corner of her head the ache of sanity passed the bricks of the wall held her there, eyes quenched, darkness about the mouth her back to the words. She was a crafter moulding her absence with bare hands, dovetailing silences, learning and learning, blind and divining the age of shadows, their grainy touch, the lie of them. We brought her shelter, a cardigan of words she would seldom wear; the nouns she devoured, survival balanced, melting, on the tongue; but the verbs, tensed in their paradigms, she had no purpose for, and cast away. e 81 \n￼Berkeley 55-96 19/8/94 5:05 pm Page 1, Mist The singing goes on, lonely, in the mist long after dark. Up on my second I follow the score. On the window face a clammy smile, spreading, white, nothing behind the eyes, the chilled limbs invading my few I turn to find at home, comfortable in my easy chair, body without bone, floor rooms. whispering with the books, sweating the air, exchanging looks with the family photographs, billowing secrets under its breath. The kitchen cradles the dark, the fridge has started quietly to hum to my foggy guest, the phone shrilly fails to ring. If it would only rain and damp down my unwelcome friend, or I could make the move to fire, and paint my home with flame. 78 \n￼Berkeley 55-96 19/8/94 5:05 pm Page 1, Loom Our house stands quite alone on the road it darkens and darkens, the doorbell rings,the gloom we cannot let light in, we are seldom home. The house is many-cornered it has an angular voice its spirit is noosed; light from the streets makes frosted squares on wallpaper there the drive lights make more squares; shadowy paintings, blurred books jigsaw the dark, these pieces make memory up. We are kept tight within our bones by places, names, and childhood happenings, meals that have been taken there, people wearing faces they will cast away, sun shining through the rooms, getting lost somehow. No need to shape the tones, the house spins its own, that frail loom the builders raised in days, they put the wires in that hum and sing in spinning out the crazy, half-heard tunes that make the spaces at my fingertips vibrate, as though sent through a different element. 77 > 5' \n￼Berkeley 55-96 19/8/94 5:05 pm Page 7, A letter Down to cold stone to whet my heart. It is not long, the letter with the burning lines. Hearts are sore, mine sings a mournful tune I have to listen to. The beach is raw, white waves crashing down on sin, sky washed and the water in, coke can in the undertow, a gull runs shakily at the edge. Wave after wave and the foam climbing up the dark underbelly. The dark could punish but it comes too late \u2014gull takes fright. A tightness climbs my throat my wings are trembling, white envelope, the end, the wrapper, the crumbs, the dregs. The weekend falls back like a medium weight. The letter walls me out, I feel nothing and nothing is better. o '*-' 76 / \n￼Berkeley 55-96 19/8/94 5:06 pm Page 8/ Uncle All day his name has reached the satellite, come down, and clear along the line, my brother says that he dropped heavy in a room of light, heart caught on the last beat, a round stone in the deepest lake from the dizziest height. The story tells of two men working in the fields of women threshing grain how does it go? That one will stay - the grain lie lonely in the palm and the chaff be blown. All day long my uncle drops, the ripples open out. He has mislaid the place where words wait. There must be another alphabet known wherever there is sun. I long to speak that simply. 83 \n￼Berkeley 55-96 19/8/94 5:06 pm Page 8, Tightrope Beneath the taut rope your arms go up in a shudder of sparks, your fireworks light my act, you are ready to catch. But my fall is feather-downed, limbs weigh little in this dream I live the whole descent through its blurred veil it makes me a Catherine wheel, a quick storm in a dry time. Something leads me safely down the cool tunnel of the fall bone-dry and skeletal I touch stone on both sides, you spread the nets below and I realise that before I flew was a dark time - I might have been some huddled animal digging and blind; cold head, fogged heart that would never clear, never drink the sun - and I land in a gauze of tears. 6* 84 / \n￼Berkeley 55-96 19/8/94 5:06 pm Page 8, Sea-borne I smell sea-salt from my thoughts I begin to be obviously sea-borne, as you were once dragged from the water\u2019s womb, slimy, sea-green, wreathed with foam, wearing the weeds o f birth. At your beginning trees bent, used to one wind, you gave them another, sent it teasing from leaf to leaf, such early greens, yours was a clean breeze I took it long before the offered hand, it blew warm; later on, hope against hope, I leaned full into it and you suffered me to change as the light when an object turns. You knew by the shy red stealing to my skin that I had opened flood-gates and would let the ocean in; you keep a wind always to my back, and though my heart is in my mouth, silence is by far the harder cry. 82 \n￼Berkeley 55-96 19/8/94 5:08 pm Page 9, Fault I was not built for the dull rumble of the valley air, the great steel birds that fly with a dark grey whine, grazing the sky. They fly low in the blue face of it, they spell out its naked state, the clouds are at bay. The fault sniggers beneath the highway, she cracks her knuckles publicly but keeps apart her joy, narrow and deep; some day she will send a flame from the scorched well of the earth and burn off the teeming human layer, she will burst her corset of rock and take the air, she was not meant for the brittle rib-cage of the bay. e 91 \n￼Berkeley 55-96 19/8/94 5:09 pm Page 9, Valley Wherever you look she answers back. You know her by the jewels set shallow and close for eyes that narrow and are never shrewd. You know her by the good bones, the many thoughts that fall on gold, her friends are few or they hide; her smile is broad while out of the bullets of fast cars she invents a war, under their hail of horns only such surface gestures can be made, the nod, the solemn waver) Q when there is cause to celebrate,^ her laughter is canned, a cast of hawks falls on her parade. I know her for a young girl, virginal, pure, you skin your knuckles trying to knock some love from her. \n￼Berkeley 55-96 19/8/94 5:08 pm Page 8, Slender girls Into the risky waters of another month, bottle and paddle, milk-crate raft, the children shout from the beach but she goes against the small choppy waves, salt in her wounds. yellow green, and there is no bed, she wears a fluid dress, she\u2019s a thing of grace now, a girl from a family of slender girls, she\u2019ll swim like this on the last day in the first sea, exulting in the sweet milk of being alone in it, and when the water calls for a change of element, she\u2019ll breathe it in and that will be easily done. 88 e ","docTitle":"","docDate":"1994-08-19"},"meta":{"contentType":"text/raw","emVer":"7.1.1103.5","langIdVer":"DefaultLangId","processingVer":"CalaisJob01","submissionDate":"2014-07-01 09:46:39.202","submitterCode":"57b17a53-6e34-87b0-20ff-a419896f49c9","signature":"digestalg-1|1IrpPkrtehZn9h+JbwTZfkZm6l8=|LKSAXEIp7avJELvhcWRAzwq+NRmSqBZ/uVJDomELcNQQhN4mcbKHYQ==","language":"English"}},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/0551fbaa-69b1-3cee-9291-d98c40eba6cb/cat/1":{"_typeGroup":"topics","category":"http://d.opencalais.com/cat/Calais/Hospitality_Recreation","classifierName":"Calais","categoryName":"Hospitality_Recreation","score":0.556},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/0551fbaa-69b1-3cee-9291-d98c40eba6cb/lid/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http://d.opencalais.com/lid/DefaultLangId/English"},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/68d7bc63-b563-3dd3-ac5e-b5afc3ef36d7":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"IndustryTerm","name":"paint","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/IndustryTerm","instances":[{"detection":"[friend, or I could make the move to fire, and ]paint[ my home with flame. 78 \n￼Berkeley 55-96 19/8/94]","prefix":"friend, or I could make the move to fire, and ","exact":"paint","suffix":" my home with flame. 78 \n￼Berkeley 55-96 19/8/94","offset":3267,"length":5}],"relevance":0.266},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/eb98f9d0-d774-3b68-8a61-82783def207a":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"Position","name":"cold head","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/Position","instances":[{"detection":"[ have been some huddled animal digging and blind; ]cold head[, fogged heart that would never clear, never]","prefix":" have been some huddled animal digging and blind; ","exact":"cold head","suffix":", fogged heart that would never clear, never","offset":6139,"length":9}],"relevance":0.122},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/94ba09bb-8c39-3207-a8a9-75f60b194cab":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"IndustryTerm","name":"steel birds","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/IndustryTerm","instances":[{"detection":"[ built for the dull rumble of the valley air, the ]great steel birds[ that fly with a dark grey whine, grazing the]","prefix":" built for the dull rumble of the valley air, the ","exact":"great steel birds","suffix":" that fly with a dark grey whine, grazing the","offset":7120,"length":17}],"relevance":0.105},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/6cd68992-8bd5-351f-a303-73fabe75838e":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"Facility","name":"Airport We","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/Facility","instances":[{"detection":"[e 75 \n￼Berkeley 55-96 19/8/94 5:05 pm Page 8, ]Airport We[ split seconds as the engines climbed to drown]","prefix":"e 75 \n￼Berkeley 55-96 19/8/94 5:05 pm Page 8, ","exact":"Airport We","suffix":" split seconds as the engines climbed to drown","offset":1400,"length":10},{"detection":"[ of shadows, their grainy touch, the lie of them. ]We[ brought her shelter, a cardigan of words she]","prefix":" of shadows, their grainy touch, the lie of them.
