Their unexpectedness and their unexpected power, that made such an impact on me, are the important things about them. In any case, I have nothing illuminating to say about their background, for all my knowledge of it comes from them. All I have is a small, rather dog-eared notebook of forty unlined pages, each with a poem pencilled upon it in English. The dedication and the quotations from Lear and Jonson are scribbled inside the front cover. At the head of the first page is written Poems of Z. In passing Z's notebook to the publisher I have become involved in preparing the poems for the press. When he made revisions Z's usual practice was, it seems, to erase the original - pencil stitched/and smudged across a grubby page' - but where he has not done this I have taken the two readings as alternatives, and have chosen the one I judged the better. I have also made a small handful of amendments to Z's sparse punctuation, for the sake of clarity or consistency. Z seems to have been engaged in intelligence activities in the U.K. for a number of years. The poems are certainly about that, but I think it unlikely that our counter-espionage ► service will glean much from these pages. The poet - for this is what, in a crisis of self-examination, Z became - is not concerned with ^Names and Places/Technical Detail, Plans/ Political Praxis, Miscellaneous1; he asks %hat does the heart know1, and writes of his own tenderness and violence, duplicity and openness, his faithlessness and spiritual hunger. From his Byt C A P S centre-4 \n￼IDs ICQ world within our world, employing our language, he casts a cool eye on England, 'the England I love* . He speaks movingly of the world of his childhood; the spy remembers his father and writes; I inxknfc Qerv\\5 lod<r\\t, 6er»\\$ # ,all the seasons gone for which he, his weathered face upturned, gathered intelligence Here we have an extraordinary view of an extraordinary poetic development,, The start must have been tentative, hut once assured of what he was about I feel sure that Z wrote the poems as they stand in the notebook, one after another, each dependent on the one before, each qualified by the next. They demonstrate a sharpening of vision and a hardening of intention probably unsuspected at the outset. The naivety of the enterprise was to Z, I think, an essential element of it. Its success was perhaps as much of a surprise to him as it is to us. He felt it was not attainable in his own language. That Z should write so well in English is surely remarkable, but it is also crucial to his purpose: Qj-1j l. ^1 need decode the words , I I'i/ll \\n4e^ ^muscles at his tongue's root fought with the air in his open mouth <3\u2018 a crock at the end of an arc of blood.

No shame a room with oil-light lying in elbow-warm water the grown flesh fallen away bathing in the iron bath supported by my mother's arm her free hand rinsing my limbs She sings to me in my own tongue songs I will forget in London I pitch my gurgles back to her my poems she can't understand \n￼in C12ft^ You see there is nothing naive and sentimental as a grown man with soft hands and a calloused heart starting out as poet The idea of it anyway. From my rented table through the spacious grid of sash windows I keep watch on Georgian London As I once spied from a pane set into thick thatch on my father in the yard the pigs rooting, my sisters walking out in the wood when I should have been sleeping. Opposite, the porticoes in line the columns and pediments all at once I am astonished at the weight of masonry I walk in and out of every day \n￼In the streets of language I need no maps any more. If I were to try words of love my tongue would taste of their dust and litter Intimacy that is paid for - after sleepless nights sometimes street signs are foreign flags pinned to great architecture ids veer off at wrong angles I am a beast turned drab driven in from the far country to scavenge in dustbins and basement entries tainted by offal and old bones My lack of condition my dullness is protective colouration for mission the noblest drive of my kind depraved appetite and paper my belling hark that should fly meadows and pierce woods pitched off monstrous buildings in the streets of language \n￼As a boy I was one learning to be more One with the pigs in their pen far inland chucking them acorns from a holed bucket, the sea a dream of passion ft One with my sisters' boys little man among little men One with my aunt in town in my white stiff things One for my first communion One for the party, party-man In London now I am Legion for we are many 1would invite my pigs here for my first communion - they would rush outwards in all directions And every English shore they dashed themselves over trotters gashing own throats would wash with their gore I would be one I have learned to be more \n￼z V- The pigs stay at home I wade the English shores where burns and becks empty with great sewers called rivers 4 Or I dive in the deep waters - one of my elements - rouse oysters from their beds like drowned corroded fruit They are hard nuts to crack with crabbed brown hands and a stainless knife's sharp point, broad haft I unhinge and chuck hundreds the years, a stinking midden the pearls, mostly small and grey I send home to the pigs \n￼Beneath that heap of shells my father points downriver to tell me that it runs through another country all the way to the sea off his tongue ■he has not seen it hut knows it's worth talking about - it is salty he says and larger than all the land I lie dreaming of it its smell comes up through cracks in the floorboards from bacon curing under rafters under my bed # With cows on the riverbank I sniff for it but turn to face the mountains where it comes from v jre rain from the sea falls Nothing, not thunder, not flood nor cataract prepared me for the raw deep voice of it under the deck, the lullaby of her who bore me on her breast Years dulled that wonder the shells a heap of deaf ears. Now I sift through their clatter clutching them at my head listening for the voice of my father \n￼I creep nearer and nearer - my sisters hide their faces even safe inside the house - the nuzzled ground slavers and sucks at my shoes * I creep close to my father and his friend G*** and the pale pig standing bound between them father shaving its throat 4^ A quick sliced stab and blood - though I know it trickled I see it spurt in an arc a thick monotonous rainbow caught in a crock 4^ The arc of the pig's scream stopped in my ears - ten minutes before silence trotters trying to flail blond eyelashes still 44 Only when the blood stops at last I start to cry a complicated wailing , father reproves with his glare to my sisters' scorn I creep away \n￼That was the first time I approached slow death under a waxing moon Father's apprentice, I know the pig's swan-song well never two the same I know it well, I feel it coming from the throat the beast's strain in my hands My hands shake as I write I can't translate, in English I cannot make you hear it ","docTitle":"","docDate":"2014-07-01 09:54:06.970"},"meta":{"contentType":"text/raw","emVer":"7.1.1103.5","langIdVer":"DefaultLangId","processingVer":"CalaisJob01","submissionDate":"2014-07-01 09:54:04.895","submitterCode":"57b17a53-6e34-87b0-20ff-a419896f49c9","signature":"digestalg-1|QFn5R28lsokF6xeQFX+uN0brNFM=|gvZU+YBrEwmbDyUgqX8Adlz255B9ZaD6KIo7x7EnmknQertaGNNQRQ==","language":"English"}},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/4769a9da-e3a9-354b-af18-371cd8709178/lid/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http://d.opencalais.com/lid/DefaultLangId/English"},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/0bb20aaf-7b90-325a-a09a-2b596041c834":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"Position","name":"professor at S**","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/Position","instances":[{"detection":"[pages it speaks I will hand them to my friend ]the professor at S**[*, he will translate back into my own tongue That]","prefix":"pages it speaks I will hand them to my friend ","exact":"the professor at S**","suffix":"*, he will translate back into my own tongue That","offset":4421,"length":20}],"relevance":0.109},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/ebb0a6ac-92fc-359c-8502-dce14e312553":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"Position","name":"poet","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/Position","instances":[{"detection":"[► service will glean much from these pages. ]The poet[ - for this is what, in a crisis of]","prefix":"► service will glean much from these pages.
