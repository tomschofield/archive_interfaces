Stoking-up, you flesh that sparse -4- contracted source. The flame-points swell with wings and cobbled smoke. 4- Masking a fist, you weave-in half-burnt wood tuff of lichens to fissure in fire - 4 and stand away, watching how vtlje falling-up of heat quarries air of flakes and finity. A sculptor works less openly, releasing stone in secret, scraping through caves to find a captive, hands like drills. The binds of stone ^ vi shrivel to his touch: a plying flame as fumbles out of smoke. He makes 4-v his fist a phoenix; hands he turns are wings that clench a fire, 4\" a beak that bites is chisel in this stone... The warm wings lift a trembling limb from rock: a dust, like smoke, veers into air. \n￼72- - 6 ^ I came to a place where buildings were going up; biscuits of slate sat wrapped in twine. Earth moved like sugar, boiling against the metal of a dumper. A machine dropped, dropped its yellow snout, nuzzling at joists it hammered-in. When I got to my father I would learn the heat of that impact, how you might light paper from it two hours on... The air meanwhile would shiver with fire, a^jjineless dust, the shouts of impact. He was with the welders - short-term hire - cutting thin plate to microns. Not visored, he stood out from that coven_________________ of kneeled and sparking men like something they were making or melting to start over. We went out to sandpiles, pounded stone, his eyes spindling, his mouth asking and asking why I was there. (■ Errand 10 \n￼Metal-work The lathe we were at kept cutting-out in little deaths; our anger slid. Under a blade sheet-metal split. I stood where my father stood me: this side of a lathe. Weathers of dust fell to a hush at my feet. I did what he asked: watched calipers twitch legs skinny, an avocet's; 4? but looked beyond: to drill-heads primed, fluted like wands of steel. .=fc He halved the work: held mandrels, clamp. Drills spoke for him, talked themselves out. \n￼JlAVTTL-MSSI^Jf-\u2014v _ 5 E R i r r sf t e T I ^ E AIR STREET Deer-tracks - I followed them: made a forest slide through a deer's eye; felt TpVMV for myself the trodden dints of hoof, shorthand codes cut on the frost... ~7-|7Tt '4 Pitch of night: insurgent shrews ♦ scatter* in dissidence between owls. My torch-beam welds them to the ground; I could gather them like moss. The air as well, corrupt with movement, walks with me like gravity and, step-by-step, it flenses sound to whispers of a deer-cut. Where the tracks street together - passes of a scalpel - with torch-light off, eyes wide for catlight; I read their musks like creosote -lyivV and saw the deer - a herd of ten - scent me there, and go. 1Morning took me southwards; levelled on fat curving rails, restive station platforms, ticks of rain. As if trespassing I cut the close-wire of people. frw ~73> \n￼DAVID MORLEY FERRY HOUSE AMBLESIDE LA22 OLP -7^ o<~\\ Gundogs grabbed me at traffic-lights. Gamekeepers in Downing Street 77^4 met my stare. It was night delivered me this: a street lit by nothing - near where I could sleep - with a name like nothing: AIR. And I walked it without torch-light sensitive for the wear of previous creatures, (YU r \n￼MARDALE HEAD A reservoir, filling, cut out a village in a flag of grey, halo-ing folds, indulging walls their done-with labour. Thud &- at the damstone, a door slammed shut. Then they grieved for sheep still out: wily beggars slipping collie-dog nets. Compensation came like drizzle on water and wouldn't add... A stop-go track lopes up to nothing: the dam, its forehead half-blown-off. Winds relevel what water-blades cancel: ■&- stove, trellis, the twines of washday. Now, as this osprey confuses surface and fishlight, skylines narrow, a tightening wire, precarious with fresh weather. \n￼EXACT £ ARES Even now, angle-poised over a desk he takes his cue from the barbiturate of what was seen. Remembering rain: how a single droplet breaks its back on the hurrying window of a No. 3 bus. Or the fly: simmering on vibrated glass, intellectual, in that spiderless prison... A man in corduroys unscrews a flask and shares warm tea with a woman he hated. He does not see a fly browse on the brim of their plastic mug, or the way raindrops garrotte the nerves of his rheumatic wife. We are sick with fear the drunk will miss his stop, lolling over the seatback, leaving it our decision. 37 \n￼JERUSALEM Ballymurphy painted white, inside and out; road-blocked suburbs, then the accomplishment of a bounding wall to stop the desert\u2019s abstract itch. This achieved, we grew fluent 4- in our dialogues: the limit on sense was vox pop, as was ambivalence about a noun for boredom. Came the day a master of lexicography motorbike-jumped the lower wall-sectors and made off for the border. He was taken alive, displayed in the central archives ( r\u2018 r public vasectomy and grammar - confiscation), writing, rewriting in blackened sand, Lift up vour hearts and sing. \n￼7b D E%M3&MiQrley^z3Qi THE POLITICISATION 0 F T H E NORTH WIND \u20143 \\A/(=>ramemitc^fo IInHorthoaonono\u2022uontarl We came out safe, under the aspens; wanted the road south, but winds deflected our point of reference to the motorway. A Police Rover winks on its orbit round an arterial lane. Cobs of leaf-litter give way to a blackbird\u2019s enquiry. Ivy dripfeeds an oak, as if accidentally. We need the road south, but accidents are happening. A rescue party sifts the rubble of falling leaves; a hand of the law harries us down turn-offs - its flickered blue flame; a kestrel makes its one-off bid in a plunging market We circle a bend with a sign saying Motorway Regulations Terminate Here. Aspens. Wind. Regulations terminate here. ENNISKILLEN There was a speedboat ploughing up Lough Erne, an activity Ithought the local RCJC would take no shine to. Iwatched three little grebes make with the rhythm. Imagine my discomfiture when the boatman waved then a four-eyed warden told me to push off. I plucked up my fag-ends, enough, never enough; followed laqer cans to the centre of Enniskillen, ib a place, now, infamous as Walsingham, and shrine to all discomfiture.
