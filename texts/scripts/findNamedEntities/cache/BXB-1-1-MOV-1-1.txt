In the title poem, past and present, divine and secular, are ironically juxtaposed; his uncertainty echoes Rimbaud's, but whereas Rimbaud re-created his vision through dense symbolism, Vincent Morrison explores a physically recognisable world which contains his frame of reference: \u2018Above the turquoise slates of Aloaha/ a floodlight like the moon, or David\u2019s star.\u2019 Some poems recall winters in North-East England, but Morrison does not limit himself to personal experience; others delve into imagined situations, sometimes with hints of the surreal.
