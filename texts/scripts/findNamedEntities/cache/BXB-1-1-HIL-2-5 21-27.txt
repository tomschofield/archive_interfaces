She has tucked her wild-looking chicken under her arm and stares out over what seems to be a mountain pass on a windy day. She is wearing a blue linen dress the colour of summer. She reminds me of Brunhilde - alone, bronzed, unfamiliar. She doesn\u2019t look like anybody\u2019s mother. II She used to love dancing. She went to the Chelsea Ball dressed as a leopard; there she met my father, who looked so dashing in the Harlequin suit his tailor made for him from raw silk. He had tiny shoes like Cinderella\u2019s. I have seen them. Ill She comes to collect me from school, on time, silent, and I hand her my coat and satchel - avoiding, even then, her lovely eyes, that look down on my world like distant stars. I play with the girl next door, and don\u2019t come home till bed-time. & 21 \n￼Hill Trembling 10-24 3/2/94 12:55 pm ,f>*ge 22 11 IV From the lighted window I watch my mother picking leeks in the twilight. I will have soup for my supper, sprinkled with parsley. She passes me my creamy bowl. My hands are warm, and smell of soap. My mother\u2019s hands are cold as roots. She shuts up the chickens by moonlight. V How can they think I am asleep when he bends down and kisses the nape of her neck, and goes away to his own room, while she sits in front of her mirror and brushes and brushes VI The hens are all gone. How happy she used to be setting out in her long tweed coat across the orchard with her bucket. Chuck, chuck, chuck, she called and they\u2019d all come running. her waist-long silver hair? 22 -e- \n￼Hill Trembling 10-24 3/2/94 12:55 pm ,P»ge 23 VII She walks behind the hedges of the large garden, stooping from time to time to pick narcissi for her mother\u2019s grave, now that it is Easter. We don\u2019t want to go. We\u2019re too young to remember our grandmother - and besides it will be cold in the grave-yard where the wind blows straight in off the downs. VIII He went to his room with an orange in his hand, and died there sometime during the afternoon. My mother spent the day in the kitchen. When I came in from the garden I was sent upstairs to call him down to tea: £pe was sitting by the window with his back to me. On the table beside him were four boats made of orange peel, with the pith piled neady inside them. My mother couldn\u2019t stand up. She kept on saying she was sorry, but she couldn\u2019t stand up. It must be the shock she said. It wasn\u2019t grief. Come and sit down she said, And have your tea. IX Tonight I kissed my mother, for the first time that I can remember; though I must have kissed her before, as all daughters kiss their mothers. 23 \n￼Hill Trembling 10-24 3/2/94 12:55 pm ife 24 She was passing in front of me to kiss the children, and I leant down and touched her cheek with my lips. It was easy - like the lighting of a candle. X My sister always says that on the morning our father died he was working on a drawing of a liner disappearing over a white horizon. She says it is a symbol. She\u2019s got the picture by her bed. I would rather think of dying as a coming into harbour, a sort of final mooring. XI You put in at a little jetty. There is someone there to welcome you - not sinister - but rather surprising - someone you know. In front of you rise banks of fern and shining celandines. You can smell the woods. They are full of life, but very still. XII My mother and I, in our way, understand each other. When I kneel by her grave, in need of a little consolation, I will picture her standing on a hillside in bright sunlight, lifting her hand to wave to me; or is she brushing away the feathers that drift like dreams into her hair and tickle her cheek, till she smiles/ \n￼Hill Trembling 25-58 3/2/94 1:00 pm P,a3e 25 MY DARLING CAMEL -e- (1988) \n￼Hill Trembling 25-58 3/2/94 1:01 pm Raje 26 The Sea-Water Hall (i.m. Eileen Berryman) The illuminated flickers in the darkness. All down the hall, fish circle sadly in their twili^t cubes. The amphibians have little beaches too. Here\u2019s a nice spot - a perfect naked man, three inches tall, is sitting by a rock-pool. He\u2019s writing something in a book. When the keeper drops a pinch of powder from the sky, there\u2019s a lady who runs up with a picnic plate and catches as much as she can. Come on, John, she says, They seem to be trying to kiss - in air that\u2019s too viscous for them. He climbs onto a ledge of rock and stares at the painted ocean. DO NOT TAP THE GLASS you really ought to eat something. She fingers her neglected curls and looks across at him as if she\u2019ll never kiss him now. He\u2019s coughing phlegm. It slithers down the inside of the glass. \n￼Hill Trembling 25-58 3/2/94 1:01 pm Eaje 27 e- The gang-connector\u2019s not working properly. It\u2019s getting hot in there. He dives into the water like a knife, disturbing the forests of green eel-grass. The lady covers her body with cream, and wishes she were happier. If you do tap the side, she won\u2019t look up. It\u2019s triple-glazed. She can only hear the keeper\u2019s dry fingers and the bubbles rising.
