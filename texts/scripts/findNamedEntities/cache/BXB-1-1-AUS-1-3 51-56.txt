Once it was only one layer thick, almost transparent; once, before, it was not there at all - the very air was garrulous and her lips kissed that, breathing, speech, embraces barely differentiated. But she can hardly remember then: memory too must push through silence and may be discouraged in the dense maze of gum, the thorn thicket keeping familiar princes back and away from kissing. 2 The child shielded the doll\u2019s head with one hand from the rain, though the hood of her own mackintosh was still flat upon her shoulder-blades. They had stepped from the greengrocer\u2019s doorway into a downpour like glass curtain behind glass curtain over and over. \u2018Oh,\u2019 she cried, and \u2018oh\u2019 again, while her sister danced with covered hair under the falling water. \u2018It\u2019s Christmas and weddings and silver paper suddenly, but I think my doll will melt in all this wetness.\u2019 Her mother said, \u2018Don\u2019t talk nonsense!\u2019 and the littler girl turned round and round with her feet in dazzling puddles. The child in question started to apply the paper silence. 3/ \u2018We slung a curtain on a string across the room to achieve some privacy for each of us. I would sit sealed-off and try to hear her reading, to listen to her sewing with silent thread and needle. 51 \n￼\u2018Her quiet tantalised - though surely not on purpose - until the whole of my existence in that place was waiting for a movement\u2019s rustle, watching the dark for light strained through hung fabric. \u2018I grew to want her for the shadow that she made upon my mind, the faintest she-suggesting staining of the air in front of me, wherever I might look; my marriage, in the end, was to such ghostliness.\u2019 4 In fact she spoke a good deal within the sounding-box of her skull; she recognised her own real accents in the soft contralto retailing judgements while the face she assumed hung expressionless over the table like the Baptist\u2019s head offered on a platter to them all... and he kissed it as Salome nuzzled those cooling lips, thinking something had been attained by decapitation. Inside, her voice buried deeper as the worm or mole does, leaving a smaller and smaller echo to surface for a cast of earth at the back of her eyes. She doubted any change was noticed in the glazed gaze on the dish pushed to one side. 5 The doll her daughters played with - putting it to bed in the pram, taking it out to have its clothes changed, showing it the garden, an^so on - had grown near faceless with this use, eyebrow and mouth paint gone. She hated it, without reasons she could speak - little homunculus, grey-pink foetus - pulled the quilt up and up to cover its forehead, obtrusive in the nursery cot, her look drawn there despite the other tumbling toys around. And when they paraded it in a new dress for her, she could not praise, but turned away to book or needle, erecting a thorn thicket of interlacing branches, a curtain to withhold and hide even her children. \n￼Austin 35-64 10/2/93 4:40 pm Page 53 6 What gets left behind is often not intended to be found; despite the old wives\u2019 saws, clean underwear is not donned for every fresh foray into the streets of traffijrt'. The moment itself selects the meal in preparation, what half-written letter is there lying on the desk. q ^ I h i c l o 5 c In her case it was the doll-sized babies\u2019 bones, wrapped-up in layers of paper and stowed in a chest, that remained after she withdrew her quiet into the absolute silence. It rained again that day, and they could not understand what they had found. Without her heard interpretation, everything was conjecture, all metaphors of gum and princes, melting, a severed head. 53 f \n￼-e- Pen and Paper Before the ladder to the platform closed in by fleering voices, the tying of the feet, the laying on the tilted board face down but with no place for cheek or lip to rest on, before the oblique blade, the bloody basket; arrived at the foot of the scaffold, Madame Roland asked that she might have pen and paper to record \u2018the strange thoughts rising in her\u2019. Request refused, as if it were some clever-dick trick of postponement; the page remaining at the stationers, the quill untrimmed, the strange thoughts in the skull as in a vase that spj^fJ; them quite illegibly under the guillotine a moment later. A fate she knew could not be much delayed, she would not read her own words back to her at leisure after, what she felt urged to keep could not be kept by her more than a minute\u2019s space; but nonetheless she wanted pen and paper, meant to snatch out of the blood-stained air those phrases that would cage the strangeness lifting through her now. For only words could net and hold the foreign birds long enough in her sight for naming, recognition under the single lightning-flash that time had left her; only with pen and paper could she possess her death, the momentary owner of a basket loud with wings that the imminent blow would knock from her hands and scatter.

It is night. The light has drained into metal vessels: lean over that great mixer to catch its dying gleam \u2014 some fallen star going widdershins down the black plughole. The owl wakes in its ruin, the broken bakehouse wall, where the window that was peeled back, fraying bricks, its whitewash dropped dunes of new flour; the whole of the dark flooded in. There are black loaves baking in the ovens\u2019 doorless caves. The owl attends them, busy between this slab and space, its white flight-feathers quivering like the shapes in antique movies recovered just in time, their silver edges eaten.

We played in the vacant bakehouse in the afternoons, riding down chutes meant for loaves, or rolling in the loft\u2019s fat waves of flour-bloomed sacks. She wanted to be a ballet-dancer - might have been, but for the off-white filaments of dough that bound her, hand and foot, to the little shop with their home stuck to it and the big, low bakehouse, like a grounded ship behind. The abattoir-keeper\u2019s daughter made a third - with no similar skein of flesh to hold her. She was the first vegetarian I knew; Orv\\.<* b r 1through her skin shrunk back white on her bones (,o'e,u\u2019t w^en she told us, how market-gardeners and farmers fed their land with the slaughter-house blood. She disliked owls, for their killing, the carrion smell of their nests. And I was a grocer\u2019s child, a grocer\u2019s grand-daughter. Our shop was across the road from the start of a wood, where the jays laughed by day and owls screeched and hollered throughout the night. It was down the hill to the bakehouse with pavements, roads and dwellings all around; there the birds\u2019 dawn chorus was thin at best... In the end that daughter had to go to bakers\u2019 college. 3 Walls beyond walls all around; and men and women, children strategically placed, observing or turned away from the owl in a cage in the pet department. 56 e ","docTitle":"","docDate":"1993-10-02"},"meta":{"contentType":"text/raw","emVer":"7.1.1103.5","langIdVer":"DefaultLangId","processingVer":"CalaisJob01","submissionDate":"2014-07-01 08:44:39.452","submitterCode":"57b17a53-6e34-87b0-20ff-a419896f49c9","signature":"digestalg-1|JymK601hw4s+uFMXCfVMW8t0DNo=|XstDIc8MNERavr/OcX2Z+woVaVRyWhNcFu9Nc8WnPVDFf5pgOGih9g==","language":"English"}},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/edb7ad19-f8ad-3550-a82e-592df7667ba9/lid/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http://d.opencalais.com/lid/DefaultLangId/English"},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/e8dd5ecd-f9fc-3445-bce3-57d2da2867e5":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"Technology","name":"flash","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/Technology","instances":[{"detection":"[naming, recognition under the single lightning-]flash[ that time had left her; only with pen and paper]","prefix":"naming, recognition under the single lightning-","exact":"flash","suffix":" that time had left her; only with pen and paper","offset":4926,"length":5}],"relevance":0.168},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/402755aa-cbfa-3f0c-b2fe-101e52801227":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"City","name":"Austin","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/City","instances":[{"detection":"[ ￼]Austin[ 35-64 10/2/93 4:40 pm Page 51 The Silent Woman 1]","prefix":" ￼","exact":"Austin","suffix":" 35-64 10/2/93 4:40 pm Page 51 The Silent Woman 1","offset":2,"length":6},{"detection":"[to withhold and hide even her children. \n￼]Austin[ 35-64 10/2/93 4:40 pm Page 53 6 What gets left]","prefix":"to withhold and hide even her children. \n￼","exact":"Austin","suffix":" 35-64 10/2/93 4:40 pm Page 53 6 What gets left","offset":3119,"length":6},{"detection":"[blow would knock from her hands and scatter. ]Austin[ 35-64 10/2/93 4:40 pm Page 54 54 / \n￼Austin]","prefix":"blow would knock from her hands and scatter.
