He was far less well-known as a poet than he deserved to be. This claim is made regularly for writers once celebrated and thereafter neglected, when their works are reintro  duced to the public. With Bell, it is nothing more than the plain truth. Martin Bell is one of the major poets writing in English in the second half of the century, and the fact that his work has been largely unobtainable since his death (and fugitive even in his lifetime) makestheissueofthisCompletePoemsanimportantandtimelyevent. Bell\u2019s publishing history is singular. His first book was also his Collected Poems and his last publication. His precocity as a poet suffered an early frost due both to war service and to personal circumstances, so that his flowering came in early middle age - especially in the decade 1955 to 1965. He was one of the three poets included in volume three of the newly-established series Penguin Modem Poets in 1962 (the others were George Barker and Charles Causley). The poems in this Penguin formed the basis of his hardback Collected (Macmillan, 1967). The hundred-odd pages of this book are a brilliant distillation of his talent, and, until his death, comprised his life\u2019s work on view. He published nothing further, other than to contribute occasional poems to magazines and journals. Several of his enterprises for publishers, during his years living in Leeds, included poems, though none of these larger designs was brought to a successful conclusion. Many poems were written and given to friends, and much other material was left among his papers at his death. The greater part of his legacy to posterity from this period is contained in his translations of French poets of the Surrealist epoch, which I refer to later in this introduction. Nevertheless I have had a considerable mass of poetry to go through in order to compile what I feel may justifiably be called the Complete Poems. Complete here means everything of Bell\u2019s which is original poetry, and not translation, prose exegesis, memoir or diary. The book inevitably falls into two parts. The first consists of the 1967 Collected which I have reproduced unaltered, other than to place four pieces ofJuvenilia at the front instead of assigning them to the end, as made sense originally. It seemed to me unquestionable that a book which Bell himselfprepared for the press must be made the heart of this new enterprise, a conviction sharpened by the high \n￼quality of almost everything he had chosen in 1967. The second part of the book is inevitably my choice of the poems which, as Bell\u2019s literary executor, I received from his heirs and friends. I had one crucial decision to make right at the start. Was I to include at least a sample of Bell\u2019s copious and brilliant work at translating from the French - say his versions of Rimbaud\u2019s Les Illuminations, those most difficult to render marvels of proto- modemism (nobody has done \u2018Depart\u2019 as well as he has)? After all, his own 1967 selection included his version of Nerval\u2019s \u2018El Desdi- chado\u2019, his Laforgue fantasy \u2018Winter Coming On\u2019and an even more direct translation from Corbiere, \u2018The Ballad Singer at the Pardon of St Anne\u2019. But in that volume the balance was exact: translations were set against the power of original poems and thus could be seen to carry the full weight of the poet\u2019s own personal style, however well they achieved the intention of the original French. The mass of post-1967 poems with which I was dealing was more disparate and was outnumbered threefold by the quantity of translated poetry I had to choose from. I decided, therefore, to leave out any poems which originated in other men\u2019s and women\u2019s imaginations. Such a decision does not exclude from this book, however, all trace of the presiding preoccupation of his last decade: poems, wholly his own, pay tribute to Benjamin Peret, Pierre Reverdy and Max Jacob, and the shapes and forms of much of his later verse reflects the manner of the French Surrealists. One further area of the Bell archive worried me. Joan Russell, one of his circle of friends in Southampton before the war and a regular correspondent of Martin\u2019s during the hostilities, sent me samples of the poetry he composed while in the forces. Martin Bell had decided when choosing for his Collected Poems to ignore all this material, perhaps because he had preserved little o f it. Instead, he represented his early years by merely four pieces ofJuvenilia, where the Surrealist influence is already recognisable. Mrs Russell con  firmed that she and her surviving friends ofthe Southampton circle did not possess more than a part of the work which Bell sent home to Southampton from camps in England and the Mediterranean. The passages which she sent me decided me to imitate the poet\u2019s example and not collect any of this verse here. What I have read is characteristic and touching but organised at a much less concise and powerful level than anything which Bell chose to print in his mature years. It is heavily reliant on parody and is quite derivative: nor did I ever hear him refer to his poetic output during the war. Had more of his poetry of this period survived, I might have made \n￼a different decision. Martin Bell\u2019s life can be seen all too easily as a cautionary tale of the price the poet pays for inspiration. Indeed, it is already being represented this way in some quarters. It is no secret that his later years were blighted by addiction to alcohol, and complicated by depression, lack of recognition, shortage of money and touches of paranoia. It is quite easy, of course, to accept this pattern and still go on to praise Bell as a poet - indeed, if one wants to achieve the full romantic apotheosis, the life\u2019s agony is a necessary pre-condition of the ultimate vindication. That Bell deserves wholehearted vindi  cation for a life almost religiously devoted to poetry is beyond doubt, yet such an approach to him and to his verse is both a simplification and a misrepresentation. All who knew him well will assert that he remained at all times, to use an appellation which Auden was fond of, \u2018no wet-iag.\u2019. He was a man of great charm, enormous erudition and, despite his devotion to serious literature, someone who observed the world around him with extra-journalistic sharpness and wit. The hermetic poet in him shared a sensibility with the worldly moralist and social critic. He was the true inheritor of the Auden mantle (his only rival the slightly older Gavin Ewart), and, even during his later concen  tration on twentieth-century French poetry, he kept faith with the thirties\u2019 creed of poetry as an agent of moral healing, a tracking down of the spoor of history as it is imprinted on our world. He had a highly developed sense of the poet as magus, refiner of the tribal language and high priest of psychic understanding. Sometimes it seemed paradoxical, in his later years, to find him, broke and slightly bewildered, speaking of the poet\u2019s power and pride which made him a dangerous adversary and forceful catalyst. Music andJungian con  cepts were the only orders which came near to sharing the supremacy ofpoetry in his imagination once his disillusion with the Communist Party took him out of active politics. In one of his best poems, \u2018Reasons for Refusal\u2019, Bell invokes his friend Roger Frampton, \u2018desert-killed in \u201940\u2019, as \u2018a pattern of accomplishments... johj^ed the Party first, and left it first\u2019. These words can be used of Bell himself if the accomplishments be taken further to include infallible taste in literature and moral generosity. Nor did he ever desert the idealism which possessed so many of the finer spirits of his generation: he was always a man of the Left, even if he loved to add a Gidean \u2018helas\u2019 after claiming to be so. He was prescient of the dreadful blight of right-wing reaction in which we find ourselves today, recording as early as 1961 the way things were \n￼going in an England bored with the egalitarianism and libertarianism of the post-war Labour governments We didn\u2019t want to say the way things went Pissed on the hopes we entertained, Naive, of course, but vivid and still (Christ, boy, they\u2019re reading The Times What he would have made of Thatcher\u2019s Britain I cannot imagine. My feelings vary between relief that he is out of it and regret that the philippics it would have spurred him to will never be written. We have many pre-echoes, however, in his poetry of twenty years earlier - \u2018But the terrifying thing/ Is houses/ A stake in the country Something to hand down Dismal boxes voting tory.\u2019 Martin Bell was bom in Southampton in 1918 and lived there until he was twenty-one. His father worked for the Southern Rail  way, and Bell always described his parents as lower middle-class. Certainly, there was not much money about during his childhood and manhood, and this prevented his profiting from his education to enable him to set out on a literary career - at least until he was in his thirties. The war, of course, was a further obstruction to his progress. But it was not poverty which rankled with him so consis  tently, but the fearful gentility which went with it. Poem after poem testifies to the warping influence of lower middle-class respectabil  ity, most clearly felt in people\u2019s sexual lives. Only D.J. Enright, in The Terrible Shears (\u2018Whatever sex was, it was another enemy\u2019) has covered this ground as effectively: the novelist\u2019s world of keeping up appearances, sexual timidity and class embarrassment has never much appealed to poets, and only Bell and Enright have made it eloquent as verserv, <His relationship with his mother was close and neurasthenic, as late memoirs, letters and a dream-diary indicate. One of his most sardonic poems is called \u2018Ode to Psychoanalysis\u2019 and it indicates clearly that this expensive therapy could not lift the weight of child  hood neurosis from his mind. But Bell was always able to place them in a larger context where the personal becomes the general. His perfect command of rhetoric never deserted him. The \u2018Ode to Psychoanalysis\u2019 ends with him \u2018suffering Hell because I\u2019m always overdrawn/ At the bank whose manager hovers/ Clacking revengeful shears/^Heythere!Nob^daddy!/That\u2019smyflamingsword...\u2019The lo '' ^ Blake reference is not just a neat summing up, it ties in with all the invocations to penis, bowels and negative transference, and reminds us that Freudianism is based in prophetic religion as strongly as in medical science. \n￼Bell was \u2018a scholarship boy\u2019 at Taunton\u2019s School, Southampton from 1928 till 1935, and then took an external London Honours Degree in English at University College, Southampton (now South  amptonUniversity)in1938,andaCambridgeDiplomaofEducation in 1939. Again, he held a scholarship. It was clear to all who met him in these years that Bell was a brilliant scholar, but he was also not a conformist and he attracted as much hostility as support from his superiors. In fact, the Principal of University College considered him a misfit (no games, not even any bird-watching or brass-rubbing, but an interest in French Symbolist poetry) and a ring-leader of the subversive element among the students. The opposition he aroused prevented his being recommended for academic posts, just as his parents\u2019 poverty caused his headmaster at Taunton\u2019s to advise against trying for Cambridge. Despite all this, Bell\u2019s pre-war career was not undistinguished. Two of his teachers, Vivian de Sola Pinto and J.B. Leishman, were distinguished men of letters, the first being a pioneer editor of the Earl of Rochester and the second the best-known translator (with StephenSpender)ofRilke\u2019sDuinoElegies.Therewasneveranything provincial about Bell\u2019s attitude to literature, and however hard he fought the class war he was|intimidated in the slightest by literati from the public schools and ancient universities. He knew he had read more than they had, and he knew he could write better. The paradox of his early years is his combination of confidence in his own powers (far greater than that of most budding poets) and an accompanying diffidence of expression. It was shortage of money, pressure of family and the onset of war which cauterised his career. By the time he began to bring his poetry to fruition, he was no longer a young man. Men of his own generation had pushed ahead, and it waslefttothosetenormoreyearsyoungertobecomehiscolleagues. His allegiance to the Communist Party was the talisman of those years in Southampton. It was also the centre around which his net  work of friends revolved. Many years later, in his CollectedPoems, he wrote a threnody for David Guest, one of the Southampton lecturers and a leading party member, killed in the Spanish War fighting the Fascists. Bell and his friends took Communism seri  ously, both for its doctrine and for its strategic directives. In an extended curriculum vitae, compiled as late as 1977, he describes why he volunteered for the army in October 1939. \u2018At the beginning of the war I made up my mind I was going to survive it, and told people so. I was not the type to make a military hero: in cold blood I was cowardly, I was physically clumsy, hopeless at games and PT, \n￼had a slightly deformed foot which stopped me marching in step, and bad eye-sight. I would, out of conviction at that time, have been a conscientious objector, but therparty line forbade that. In order to avoid being called up into the infantry, I volunteered for the Royal Engineers.\u2019 The party line was something they all took seriously, and although the Ribbentrop/Molotov pact was signed in these months, most Communist supporters, including Bell, did not leave the party until the full horror of Stalinism was revealed in the immediate post-war period. Bell, like so many others, began his disillusionment by read  ing Koesder\u2019s Darkness at Noon. The Party makes several appear  ances in his poems - as the true faith betrayed, as a sort of parallel to the Catholic Summa, abandoned but not forgotten (\u2018the Party Line\u2019), and as a substitute for the gorgon images of Freudian theory. \u2018Ode to Psychoanalysis\u2019 shows Bell coming to terms with two father- figures, Marx and Freud. So the analysis was cut off After I hadn\u2019t paid him For over two months - He took two-fifths of my wages. I still wanted to kill Stalin After that. But I felt I\u2019d let Freud down. The cook would not run the State, And the State wouldn\u2019t wither away, And psychoanalysis Was very expensive indeed: Postpone, for the time being, The New Jerusalem. Joan Russell\u2019s memories of their Southampton Carcle identify Martin as the inspiration of a whole Hampshire generation launched into higher education at the end of the Depression. Though he wrote regularly to many of these friends during his six and a quarter years in the Forces, he did not return to Southampton when the war ended, preferring to take up teaching in London. Southampton seems almost to have dropped out of his life, coming back only in brief appearances in poems (the fine \u2018High Street, Southampton\u2019, with its memorable comment on the blitzing of the town centre, restored in so ugly a fashion - \u2018Where is the Phoenix? Surely there was burning\u2019). Marriage was another cause of distancing. He acquired a completely new set of friends and colleagues, very much London-based. The fact that he preserved none of the poems he \n￼sent in letters to Southampton points to a resolve, however uncon  scious, to make a new start in life. But his early leadership was prescient of what happened later. With the Group, he found a new circle in which his talent could prosper, and this time he was tooled- up to take full advantage of it. Martin\u2019s wartime experience was formative in another way. It freed him from English provincialism. He served in Lebanon, Syria and Italy mainly. His war was like so many bookish persons\u2019 wars, mostly boredom in camp and apparently pointless enterprises abroad. But he relished the chance to speak French and to attend the opera in Italy (San Carlo Opera House, in Naples, where he was introduced to the basic Italian operatic repertory, and where he first saw and heard Tito Gobbf. Opera was to remain for him the art closest to poetry in its combination of humanism and irrational emotionjj. There were other aspects of army life which he appreci  ated: the 1977 c.v. has a remarkable tribute to the Royal Engineers. \u2018In the unit with which I served longest, the whole company, from the OC and Adjutant (who kept sometimes ignorant junior officers in order), through the Sergeant Major and NCOs^ (I was a lance- corporal), to the Sappers and Drivers, all conspired to keep the Com  pany\u2019s good name in spite of its short-comings, lied for each other, and kept one another out of trouble.\u2019 The same devotion to ateam characterised Martin Bell\u2019s relations with those of us later who formed the Group. He enjoyed the con  spiratorial mode of rivalry in the world of poetry, and once he had made his reputation, he never departed from a concern for the republic of letters. In this, his highmindedness was out of tune with the increasing fashion-consciousness of the sixties and seventies and led him into many disappointments. He could not understand that many of the well-known poets of his time were ruthless egotists who had little interest in promoting anyone but themselves. The pro bono publico aspect ofhis nature made him awonderful teacher of poetry, if his student was talented and genuine. He can claim to have discovered one of today\u2019s leading poets, George Szirtes, who was an art student in Leeds while Martin taught Liberal Studies there and whom he encouraged to write verse. Many other students in Leeds learned how wide and diverse European poetry is from Bell. Bell ran a sawmill in Lebanon and polished up his French there. The first poem in his Collected comes from his time in Italy, and it is a translation from Nerval\u2019s French, \u2018El Desdichado\u2019, the sonnet which T.S. Eliot gave wider immortality to by quoting from it prom  inently at the end of The Waste Land. Bell\u2019s version is not only far \\1^ \n￼and away the best that has been done, but it launches his published poems on a virtuoso note. Because he is essentially a realistic and vernacular writer, it is important to underline his virtuosity. His style is a yoking o f salient detail to rhetorical projection. T o achieve this, the poet needs to be a master of phrasing, syntax and drama: from \u2018El Desdichado\u2019 onwards, his verse is never afraid to be flamboyant, but always stays close to the spoken word. His erudition is so natural that the many references and quotations in his poetry (a tendency both natural to him and imitated from Eliot, who was his ideal model all his life) dovetail into the pattern neatly. The opposite of the \u2018know-nothing\u2019poet, Bell nevertheless has little ofthe cold academi  cism of many educated and \u2018serious\u2019 poets. He is clos^to Wallace Stevens, who felt simple emotions voluptuously, and a similar fond  ness for \u2018essential gaudiness\u2019informs Bell\u2019s verse. However straight  forward and lean, it is always rhetorical. He settled in London after the war, married and had two daughters. His first appointment as a teacher with the LCC was in a junior school whose IJeadmaster he found sympathetic. He worked as a teacher there for ten years. This part of his life is the least well- documented, since Martin rarely spoke of it. It was clearly a period of calm and consolidation in his career. The very decade itself was a time of hope but also a time of austerity, as the post-war govern  ments called on the nation to make sacrifices to build the new and hopeful Britain promised by the Labour Party. He must have read a great deal and begun to write again. Clearly, there had been troubles. Soon after demobilisation he entered psychoanalysis, which was not a success. He tells how he wrote limericks against his analyst who, while attributing them to aggression, went on to encourage him by saying something could be made of them. Bell, however, had been apologising for their imperfections, and not for having written them, and angrily told his analyst that he knew the precise weight of words and could tell a good limerick from a bad one. The upshot was uncomfortable: he appreciated that the last thing he consciously wanted the analyst to find out was that he thought of himself as a poet. It would not be going too far to suggest that he had no further need of analysis once he had accepted his calling to poetry. It was to bring him close to destitution, but it also liberated him from suburban despair. At the beginning of the fifties, he was writing poetry again, though not yet regularly. The second poem in his Collected, \u2018Benefit Night at the Opera\u2019 was accepted by J.R. Ackerley for The Listener. Bell recalls that he had worked for three years on its twenty lines. It is \n￼his first characteristic poem, being an amalgam of several actual operas, most notably Un Ballo in Maschera, plus memories o f evenings spendl in the San Carlo house, all worked into a menacing mise-en- scene in Auden\u2019s manner. A few years later, he went into his usual pub in Chiswick where an encounter with a young man changed his life. He was reading quiedy when a youthful gentleman with a cultivated and resonant voice approached him and said: \u2018Excuse me, sir, but does that happen to be a volume of verse you are reading?\u2019 \u2018It is indeed, sir.\u2019 \u2018May I enquire what it is? Surely it is Norman Cameron\u2019s translation of Rimbaud\u2019s verse-poems.\u2019 The young interrogator was Peter Redgrove, also living then at Chiswick, who immediately invited Bell to come to the newly-con  vened meetings of aspirant poets which were being held in Philip Hobsbaum\u2019s flat. This conventicle had been founded by Hobsbaum in Cambridge at the same time that Redgrove, an undergraduate who had turned from Natural Sciences to English, founded the magazine Delta. Hobsbaum continued these sessions in London and thus the Group, as it came to be called, began its ten-year life. Hobsbaum was the first chairman and may be called the Group\u2019s \u2018onlie begetter\u2019. Early members included Redgrove, Edward Lucie- Smith, Alan Brownjohn, Margaret Owen, Martin Bell, George Mac- Beth and myself. From the very first evening he attended, Bell became the father and tone-setter of Group discussions. He had read more than any of us; was, of course, older, but was also more audacious, intellec  tually wide-ranging and freer from prejudice. This is not the place to explain the Group\u2019s principles, other than to state that Hobsbaum\u2019s rule was that we should look for everything we wanted to say in the text itself, and that the person whose work was being discussed was not allowed to intervene in the discussion with explanations of his or her intentions. My memories of Martin at Group sessions are vivid: he would begin with a cough of emphatic intervention and immediately develop brilliant technical fantasies on the roneo\u2019d text which left the rest of us labouring behind. He was also a fine delineator of versification and verbal troping. He loved the camaraderie of discussion, the sense that, like any of those involved in the peripateia of the past, we were pioneers of creativity and understanding. I doubt that Martin learned from us, his juniors, much in the way of useful knowledge for his work, but he gained confidence in his audience, and, encouraged by more worldly figures, he began to \n￼send out poems. Soon after joining the Group, he read a poem, \u2018The Enormous Comics\u2019 at one of G.S. Fraser\u2019s meetings in Beaufort Street, and George Fraser took it for the TLS. In the period between 1955, when he began to come to Group meetings, and 1962, Bell wrote most of his first wave of poems, and saw them published, sporadically but with mounting success, in various journals. Group members began to make their first excursions into book publication as the decade ended. First was Peter Redgrove, whose debut was in 1960, with The Collector. Edward Lucie-Smith and I followed in 1961, and George MacBeth soon after. When my poems were accepted forthe launching ofPenguinModem Poets (publication early 1962), Bell\u2019s were already being considered for the series in Pen  guin\u2019s offices. His inclusion in Number Three of the series came later the same year. Martin Bell was now securely on the Poetry its liberating insistence that poetry was not so arcane an art that it could not be discussed helpfully. And I remember Martin as the epicentre of Group activity. Nevertheless, my strongest and fondest memories of him come from outside Group meetings, though still within the ambience of literature. He was a marvellous talker, rang  ing in all directions and into hundreds of special regions. He and I loved Auden and the thirties, while Group orthodoxy, influenced by Leavis, was suspicious of that decade and its poets. Martin and I were less than enchanted with Lawrence, another aberration by Martin\u2019s love of opera into an accompanying enjoyment of instru  mental music. We also deviated in our opinion of Britten\u2019s operas, Martin having an unswerving dislike of Billy Budd, for its sado  masochism and homosexuality, which he later passionately argued with Anthony Burgess. This analysis of Britten also informed his views of Wilfred Owen\u2019s poetry, so that when the War Requiem was performed,itwasloadedwithadoublehelpingofobloquy.Stravinsky\u2019s collaboration with Auden was a different matter and his affection and understanding of The Rake's Progress was intense. He also esteemed Der Rosenkavalier and Mozart\u2019s operas. His greatest love was reserved for Verdi, and several of his poems pay tribute to this most manly and accessible of composers. Scene. I am grateful to the Group for all that it did, and especially for Group standards. Music was a further affection, and here I was unable to extend Martin and his wife and my wife and I exchanged visits many times in the sixties, until Martin\u2019s marriage broke up. Bell-and I also did poetry readings, travelled over England and, all in all, saw \n￼a great deal of each other in this, his high noon as a poet. I owe him more than I could ever repay for his kindnesses and understandings, and for his sheer human warmth. My memories of Bell in his heyday would not be complete without some recall of the extraordinary partnership he made with Peter Redgrove. I have never met two people with a greater knowledge and relish ofpoetry in English. Their fondness was almost a musical one, in that it was the sounds of English verse which excited them - not sounds in any Sitwellian sense, that would be too limiting. Rather, it was a love of the way syntax, meaning, resonance and recall are all woven into the greatest English poetry. Sitting in the Mandrake Club one dark afternoon, I heard Redgrove and Bell give an inspired duo performance ofWallace Stevens\u2019s \u2018Sea Surface Full of Clouds\u2019. The different tones of their voices as they dealt in turn with Stevens\u2019s refrain \u2018In that November off Tehuantepec/ The slopping of the sea grew still...\u2019 was a revelation to me, always someone more moved by the phrasing of poetry than by its sound, and their concern for the dramatic poise ofpoetry approached sacer  dotal intensity. In more uproarious mood, they would give a performance ofMac  beth in cod Scottish accents, which were hardly more ridiculous than Orson Welles\u2019s voice in his film. It\u2019s surprising how well Shakes  peare\u2019s lines appear to support some kind of accentual Doric - viz. \u2018The air hath bubbles as the water hath.\u2019 One of the regular pieces in their double act was a performance of Redgrove\u2019s dialogue poem \u2018The Play\u2019, a rather Beckettian piece in which two old gentlemen outbid each other in fustian and second-childhood-fantasy. When taking part in this, Martin\u2019s residual Hampshire accent would swell to high camp Mummerset, and his intoning of the final couplet was worthy of his idol Groucho Marx: Is that my part? Now watch my art As I die as I scream as I die for my art. The serious aspect of Bell\u2019s generosity in these remarkable years, as the fifties changed to the sixties, was his own poetry, which came from him in an undiverted stream. Always a careful and revising writer, nevertheless he produced poem after poem with splendid facility. At Group meetings, we encountered many examples ofvin  tage Bell: \u2018Headmaster: Modem Style\u2019, \u2018Reasons for Refusal\u2019, \u2018Winter Coming On\u2019, \u2018Ode to Himself\u2019, \u2018High Street, South  ampton\u2019, \u2018Ode to Groucho\u2019 and \u2018Letter to a Friend\u2019. With \u2018Techniques for Detente\u2019, \u2018Zen for William Empson\u2019 and \u2018Verdi at Eighty\u2019 we approach the last stage of Martin\u2019s London \n￼period. His fantasias of an old man, whereby he invented for himself the persona of Don Senilio, show his imagination modulating out of the essentially happy years of his discovery of the Group towards the alienation and disorientation ofthe Seventies. When Don Senilio was conceived, Bell was hardly more than forty-five years old, but the character of a man washed up on the shoals of redundancy came to him with the sharpness of a revelation. His life was changing, and not in hopeful directions, despite some initially favourable moves. In 1964, he was awarded the first Arts Council poetry bursary, which enabled him to work part-time. Then, in 1967, i^e was appointed Gregory Fellow of Poetry at Leeds University for two years. He abandoned teaching, the job he had laboured at unhappily for almost twenty years. He separated from his wife, a separation felt bitterly by her. His removal to Leeds was to prove final. He never lived in London again, and saw the city only as a visitor. He regarded his life from 1967 onwards as exile. Martin always believed that if he had remained in London, both success and failure would have been more manageable. There is some reason for agreeing with him. For instance, in the early sixties he formed a close relationship with Anthony Burgess and his first wife, Lyn, then living in Chiswick. Bell and Burgess formed a double- act only slightly less playful than the Bell/Redgrove one. Burgess had him appointed opera critic for Queen magazine in 1965, in suc  cession to Burgess himself. Martin was an idiosyncratic critic of music and opera, but, in many respects, a sound and unsnobbish one. His hand lay behind some of Burgess\u2019s own judgments, especi  ally of Stravinsky and Britten, though it was Burgess who was the trained musician of the two. Bell was a jaunty figure at the opera, and claimed that the Glyndebourne authorities had waived the requirement of evening dress for him, considering him sufficiently well accoutred wearing a bow-tie to go with the small dapper beard which he affected at this time. The year 1965 was a crucial one in Martin Bell\u2019s life. In 1963, some Group members, including Bell and I, had read on the Fringe at the Edinburgh Festival. On this visit, he met and formed a lively admiration for the Scots poet Robert Garioch. Though not a partisan of Lallans, he always advocated a wider audience for Scottish poetry in England, and once persuaded several of us to put our names to a letter to The Times proposing Hugh MacDiarmid, another of the poets we met in Edinburgh, as Poet Laureate in succession to Masefield. In 1965 poetry was included among the official performances at \n￼the Edinburgh Festival for, I believe, the First and only time. A.week of readings was organised at the Freemasons\u2019Hall in George Street. Bell and I were again in Edinburgh, hoping to meet Randall Jarrell who was due to arrive from America. Alas, he walked into the freeway a month before. W.D. Snodgrass came in his place, and was wel  comed by us enthusiastically. I had been commissioned to interview W.H. Auden for BBC radio. Auden was the star of the Edinburgh series, just as he became later at London\u2019s Poetry International. Bell and I spent an evening prowling round Edinburgh desperately trying to think of things I could ask Auden. In the event, the interview was a fiasco, for which I do not blame Auden. It was an exhilarating time, in and out of the Festival Press Club, drinkingwithsuchnotablesasVernonScannell,HughMacDiarmid, Sydney Goodsir Smith, and the whole corps of London theatre and music critics. Bell had to write notices of the operas at the King\u2019s Theatre (Don Giovanni and a rare Haydn work, Le Pescatrici, unfor  tunately very dull), and I remember how thrilled he was to both stand next to Carlo Maria Giulini at the Mayor\u2019s reception for the Festival artists and to ask the maestro sympathetic questions at a press conference about the stage mechanics\u2019 strike which robbed Don Giovanni of all its scenery. The most important aspect of Edinburgh that year for Martin was his falling in love with Christine McCausland, who became the Muse of his later verse. He returned in the last year of his life to this brief episode of impassioned involvement in a verse-and-prose fantasy left unfinished among his papers. He called it Operatics and Intrusions, and the part of it he completed recreates those days at the Edinburgh Festival, on to which he grafts a few new poems and works in some of his best-known previously published verse. From this time on, Bell was determined to change his life, but the Rilkean sense of the phrase came out in tragic guise rather than in life-asserting shape. His period of office as Gregory Fellow was not a success - at least from his own point of view. He was now cut off from London, and the romance for which he made the break from his previous commitments could not be sustained - chiefly his own responsibility, since he was now drinking very heavily. A year or so previously in London, during the interregnum between his giving up teaching and his removal to Leeds, he had been take^to hospital for an emergency operation for a ruptured duodenal ulcer. He appeared to make a complete recovery from this, but his stomach was now weakened and his health in general began to decline. \n￼After the Gregory, he was taken on as a teacher of Liberal Studies at Leeds Art School, later Leeds Polytechnic. Though he carried out his duties with sporadic brilliance, he began, with the seventies, a long personal decline, coming close to despair on many occasions. I do not intend to describe, even if I could, his life in Leeds. One point needs to be stressed strongly, however. He remained an inspi  rationtoawholegroupofpeopleinthatcity- EnglishandPhilosophy teachers, students, painters, aspirant writers - persons of widely varying backgrounds and interests. Nobody talking to Martin for any length of time could miss his originality of mind. And the dis  location of his brain and his body was a tragedy for his body more than for his intellect. All the while he was lurching from one crisis to another - taking cures for alcoholism, seeking refuge in hospital from bank managers as much as from booze - he was adding methodically to his archive of translations of the French Surrealists. In this work, he was methodical and exemplary - the manuscripts are cleaner and more impeccably set out than almost any I have seen. Of course, such enterprises did nothing to improve his immediate circumstances, financially or in any other way. He was driven to all kinds of resorts to make money. One undertaking which has left behind a welcome legacy was an expedition to Cyprus in the late sixties with his friend, the painter Stass Paraskos, and Stass\u2019s family. From this visit, Martin was com  missioned to produce a travel book along the lines of Auden\u2019s and MacNeice\u2019s,tentativelycalledLettersfromCyprus.The\u2018letters\u2019which got written were mostly in verse, and I have included most of them in this volume. Bell met and fell completely for President Makarios, but much else on the trip was as nightmarish as anything Rimbaud could have imagined. Bell even hated the France he travelled through. His love was always for the language and literature of that country, not for the people - or the landscape. Before he died Martin Bell had applied to the Arts Council for a bursary to enable him to complete several projects, including his translations. By the sort of irony common in poets\u2019 lives, the money arrived after his death. I met him in London less than four weeks before he died in his sleep, and he seemed more hopeful and relaxed. What surprised most people, in the weeks after his demise, was the scale and scope of work which he left behind him. Nevertheless, it has taken many years to bring this Complete Poems into existence. The taste of the times has so far not been encouraging to a poet of Bell\u2019s commitments - he would see the point but not admire the \n￼2S' S f \n￼performance of today\u2019s dandies, the Martians, and he would be disappointed at the re-emergence of Oxbridge fashion as the dominating tone of English poetry. A programme on Radio Three which I compiled of his verse in 1983 merely earned censure from the network\u2019s cultural officers. But I trust that such neglect is a thing of the past. I have already outlined the principles on which this collection has been made. All that remains to be done in this introduction is to offer some notes on the poems printed - an editor\u2019s justification. Everything up to \u2018Pets\u2019 (page 129) comes from Bell\u2019s own Collected. I do not feel that any notes are needed. Bell offered none when he first gathered these poems together. The music which Anthony Burgess wrote for \u2018Senilio\u2019s Broadcast Script\u2019 has been retained. It presents a challenge to any amateur pianist, with its florid Lisztian bravura. All poems after \u2018Pets\u2019 come from the mass of material in Bell\u2019s possession at his death. He had some major enterprises on hand, as well as others which he had abandoned in various states of completion\u2014 \u2014 E-o 1. (J7rom~JTicCityofDreadfulSomething This was tcTbe a sort of mini-Waste|Land, castigating Leeds and all its works. At various stages, poems were added and deleted. There are other poems, which he did not include in this sequence, which also apostrophise Leeds. I have included them here, after the specific sequence under the above title. The text I have^phoaed for the sequence appears to be the closest to a definitive one among the many recensions he preserved. The title is parodied from James Thomson\u2019s City ofDreadful Night. 2. Letters from Cyprus I have given this sequence its title, since Bell\u2019s definitive text, clearly gathered from among the many pieces he had intended for the book of that name/swe, in his final fair copy, unheaded. The sequence is his own, though he obviously intended the book to contain much in the way of prose letters, as Auden\u2019s and MacNeice\u2019s did, into which these poems would have been leafed. Clearly, he regarded the project as a sort of gallimaufry where many different sorts of poem could be accommodated, even if they had little bearing on Cyprus itself. Thus the sequence includes poems about cats, London life, French poets, Leeds, his old friends, Stass Paraskos\u2019s pictures etc. At the end, I have added five further poems which may not be specifically for this undertaking but are connected by subject matter. \n￼3. Operatics and Intrusions I have described this previously, and have taken only two short poems from the text in my possession, the others being works included in Collected Poems and here used in a different context. 4. Translations from French Though I have excluded everything in this great mass of material, I shall list what is included under this heading to demonstrate Bell\u2019s application to projects which fired his imagination: MAXJACOB: Le Comet a des, 226 pages of prose poems. ANDRfi BRETON and PHILIPPE SOUPAULT: Les Champs magnetiques, 117 pages. ROBERT DESNOS: A la mysterieuse, 24 pages; Les Tenebres, 46 pages. BENJAMIN P£RET: Le Grandfeu, A selection. PIERRE REVERDY: Poemes en prose, /T7 pages; ftoiles peintes, 20 pages; La balle au bond, 40 pages. Selections from ARTAUD, BECKER, fXUARD, HfBERT, MESENS and QUENEAU, 70 pages. There are also versions of Rimbaud, which Bell seems to have thought of as lying outside this specifically twentieth century file. 5. Diaries These are in prose. One is a dream-diary he kept in the last years, in which he interprets his dreams according to Jungian lights. An extensive autobiographical diary also exists. Many letters from him to Peter Redgrove and Christine McCausland have also been pre  served. In deciding which order to put the post-1967 poetry, I have been, of necessity, somewhat arbitrary. First come his resumptions of the mask character of Don Senilio. Then Leeds is celebrated and execrated, and poems dedicated to Leeds friends are added. Some of the larger shapes among his later works are the next in line, including his addresses to Patricia Highsmith and Bing Crosby. After this, I have placed Letters from Cyprus and further poems inspired by the island and the Mediterranean. Now come poems addressed to father-figures and the Frenchmen he translated, together with ruminations on translation. Then some engaging squibs for friends and colleagues in Leeds and elsewhere. Where Bell did not provide a title, I have, in general, not invented one, so that several poems are listed in the Contents merely by their opening line or lines. This section of the book contains much of the light verse and lampooning which he wrote, including some more savage satires on literary people. Some are fragments. The tone \n￼darkens towards the end of the book. Social poems, not satires but denunciations of a crass and materialist society, follow, interspersed with mysterious, almost cryptic laments. Bell\u2019s increasing sense of his own mortality emerges in this part. As far as I have been able to date them, I have kept his final poems to the end. His parents come back in these short verses, as they do in his accounts of his dreams. His love for the lady who was his Muse is faced up to once more. Poem after poem is \u2018For C\u2019 or C\u2019s name is worked into its pattern. Their being what he calls defiantly \u2018love poems\u2019 does not prevent his weaving much self- reproach and well-observed pain into them. Almost ^ the end, dated the year before he died, is his \u2018A Vocation Possibly\u2019 which he sent to Anthony Burgess. It is a quiet poem, but a desolate one. The great majority of Martin Bell\u2019s manuscripts, in long-hand or typed, insist on capitals at the beginning of lines, and I have kept to this preference strictly. His punctuation is a much more open-ended matter. H e tended to punctuate in a lordly way, as Byron did. Perhaps both poets expected their editors to put the punctuation in for them. I have done so very gently indeed, so that there are many poems in which punctuation is sparse or non-existent. Meaning, however, is seldom in jeopardy. Lastly, there may be further poems I have not seen. This book reproduces all the original poetry that Martin Bell and his circle kept intact, except for some clearly incomplete and uncompletable pieces. Amongst the prose Bell left is a brief manifesto which is worth reproducing since its various maxims help a reader not well acquainted with his verse and the thought behind it to understand his procedures, and the strange combination in his nature ofsardonic doubt and idealist enthusiasm. He entitled itAgainst the Grain: Con  tradictory Theses. Poetry is too popular. What occurred in the Albert Hall was disaster. Poems should be detested, but irresistible. \u2018Doing one\u2019s own thing\u2019 is as obscene a pun as \u2018doing one\u2019s bit\u2019. Crowds are for contracting out of. It is necessary to postulate the existence of absolute standards, and to endeavour to approximate to them. These standards are ratios. There must be formal etiquette to disinfect applause. We are not elitists, but nevertheless have chosen ourselves. Enemies: the Don, the Administrator, the Impresario, the Journalist, the Anarchist, and Old Charlie in the corner with the squeeze-box. Conspiracy is necessary to Democracy. Ancestor-worship is essential. Pope, Baudelaire, pray for us! Th ' o necessity to satirise popular art: this function it perf< ^I'l \n￼foritself. 3 Some peophThave not yet heard that Dada is dead! The Unconscious should be treated with courtesy, not raped. Again and yet again: to purify the dialect of the tribe. We are on the Left, helas! These admonitions could be taken for reactionary only in a debased age, though they were written at the end of a simple-minded one. TheirauthorknewmoreaboutpoetrythananywriterIhaveknown.
