On a morning then The cloud had lifted and we saw the whiter Splash of the stream at the cwm mouth and the wall Throujh which the bracken trickled, behind tiiat dyke Ownerless herds of fire cropoed, unhousing Little birds but leaving springs in hoofmarks and On a craterous level above two valleys The lake where once in a cotton grass summer 3o®s-Vhite gulls lifted quietly from the surface And we undressed to bathe. I showed you afterwards Blood on a stone, feathers and a bridge of bone. Love of the dark, love of the falling silent Of everything but the stream... We left the road At nights, we trespassed over the properties By the white clue of the climbing stream, by red Lanterns of rowan. Above the stepping falls Under the lintel of the lion-gate fold And tnrough a hogg hole in the cyclopean wall We entered our sleep like children. Hand in hand we Ran some distance to the last skyline. The lake HVS\u2019HeM Still lay in a sun^jand moonlight at a time Of the soft drifting of cotton grass or when Ice clouded over our full crater of rain.

Come in and sleep now or we shall convert Our universe to ash and ice and stone. Her hung and hitter face setting against me, Look everywhere, she said, once and for all And speak of everything and show me if you can Some love still living under my truthful moon. Turning to look I gave our fields to ash, I creased the brows of hills with lines of stone, I struck the wincing surface of our lake, I wrinkled every stream. In silence then Standing triumphant by the sobbing ice I cupped my hands in trickling dust for her Whom fever shook.

Let us say rather Best is what one loves. This among any who have ever loved Never wanted proof. Consider Helen: she Whom in beauty no other woman came near Left the finest man In Greece and followed a much worse to Troy Across the sea and in that city forgot Father, mother and her baby girl.
