Let us live in free association, where is not material. Plain dealing! Believe me (though I am swaying), a bent rule is unique. We shall be shelf-employed! Today is concrete passion. Nail down this truth: I love you though the drill be rusty and the State confused. \n￼Tess, in Tunisia Released, she tilts over on her side. \u2018The Fall is only that,\u2019 she says shaking sand from her hair, \u2018when you wish returns to Paradise. Go on, forget her.\u2019 She says we are inventing new ways of shipping men and women and all her art is aiming for a raft that swimmers reach and share. She says this that it may be so. You did not worry as you lay beached together through a starless night; an obscured moon still pulls the tides of billow-talk and pillow-friends. These words come from Proverbs, Tess, and the Koran; dogs bark above our heads and yet the caravan moves on. 26 \n￼The Order of the Day IN THE MOUNTAINS 10 Back Again 11 Interlude on Mustagh Tower 12 Sandy, Topping Out on Mustagh 14 Entering Askole 15 The Winter Climbing 16 Crux 18 Three Above Namche Bazaar 19 After Everest 20 Avalanche IN LOVE & POLITICS 22 A Reader\u2019s Note 23 M azed 24 Shetland 25 About T ess 26 Tess, in Tunisia 27 Love-Torn Squaddie in Rannoch Torment 28 Still 29 Visiting 30 Annie, in Spring 31 Treaty 32 Annie 33 Gulf 34 Annie, in November 35 Ruth Says 36 Spello, in the Afternoon 37 Nut 38 Covert Action 39 Young American 40 Fishing 41 D, in a Checked Shirt 42 D, Riding 43 Heart & Irish 44 Up the Baobab 45 Exit 46 Fictions \n￼Acknowledgements Acknowledgements are due to the editors of the following publica  tions in which some of these poems first appeared: AlpineJournal, Chapman, Landfall (New Zealand), New Statesman, New WritingScot  land, Poetry Review, Poetry with an Edge (Bloodaxe Books, 1988), The Scotsman and Verse. \u2018Title of Poem\u2019, \u2018etc\u2019were broadcast on Poetry Now (BBC Radio 3).

So how\u2019s it going? Oh, wasted, youth... \u2018From Base Camp to the stream there is a path now and, the grass is yellow at the centre o f the path. \u2019 13 \n￼Interlude on Mustagh Tower In these high places we are melting out of all that made us rigid; our ice-screws hang loose on the fixed ropes to the Col. Monday in the Himalaya, the clouds are down, our objective is somewhere, but obscure - let it soar without us for a day! We lounge in thermals on the glacier, brewing and shooting the breeze, that improbable project of conversation among the living. Laughter rings across the ice. Why not? None of us will die today - that\u2019s immortality you can draw on in a cigarette, harsh and sweet, the way we like it. Steam rises from the billy, Sandy pours. It is true high, worked for, that we pass hand to hand between us with our brews. Men on ice, going nowhere and laughing at everything we cannot see but know is there - among the cloud, on the Col, a hand of some sort is tightening our screws. \n￼A Reader\u2019s Note Call him anything, call him Jim. At any road a Scottish male of a certain age stands hopeful, hesitating, lost. He scuffs the dust, unable to go on or back. I want to see him on the rack. Compressed or stretched, the heresies will show. And mock him carefully, you who go to govern or deplore, judging or not judging, in all events undone. The riders of our times left notes behind of intrigues high and low; one sings of love, another of the shredding of a document... He scans these tales of power - screwed up, corrupt, infolded, though I would not have it so. 22 \n￼The Winter Climbing (forMan) It is late January and at last the snow. I lie back dreaming about Glencoe as fluent, hungry, dressed in red, you climb up and over me. That passion claimed the darkest, useless months for risk and play. You rise up on me, I rise through you... The shadowed face of Aonach Dubh where Mai first took me climbing and as we clanked exhausted, happy, downwards through the dark, I asked \u2018What route was that?\u2019 \u2018Call it what you want - it\u2019s new.\u2019 You reach the top and exit out; from way above, your cry comes down. The rope pulls tight. What shall we call this new thing we\u2019re about? These days we live in taking care and chances. Why name it? My heart is in my mouth as I shout Climbing... 15 \n￼About Tess She cocks her head, considers another country, you. Smoke infiltrates your throat. The rasp that says you\u2019re not dead yet is the trigger of seductions. \u2018And do you ever\u2019, she enquires, \u2018act on your irresolution?\u2019 The bar\u2019s de-stabilised, you colonize each other as folkies sing of Nicaragua. \u2018All right,\u2019 one hand on hers, the other grips your car keys, \u2018Why not?\u2019 There are reasons, but they melt like wax. Relax. Tonight you cross the border. You cast huge shadows as you get into the car. 25 \n￼Shetland He sailed for Shetland, very near the edge, to bog & cliff & a celibate friend. She did her helpless best by him. He climbed all day and failed to fall. Light-hoarding stars above her bed, a full moon on the wall - he wanted to be dead, and badly. A mortal sin, she said, I tried it. Well, she was Catholic but that stuck. No way out but up. At the crux, he clutched into the chimney\u2019s heart and heaved... He taped his knuckles, she poured the wine. Only reflected light this tenderness, but still that night they lay like pardoned thieves - baffled, eased, beside her moon, beneath her paper stars. 24 ","docTitle":"","docDate":"2014-07-01 08:51:16.851"},"meta":{"contentType":"text/raw","emVer":"7.1.1103.5","langIdVer":"DefaultLangId","processingVer":"CalaisJob01","submissionDate":"2014-07-01 08:51:14.979","submitterCode":"57b17a53-6e34-87b0-20ff-a419896f49c9","signature":"digestalg-1|kWSsSAxVDlR+6QZvc40Q31pwK7Q=|jze6dNwHZLoZKCZwAcsy+Eoy6+oiMev6Yx/FwNK7cl5ZAkML8aKV3g==","language":"English"}},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/24b487e5-759b-3148-8493-e359aa2203f2/lid/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http://d.opencalais.com/lid/DefaultLangId/English"},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/e911da6b-56e4-3544-9357-5d79d01c1538":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"Position","name":"author","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/Position","instances":[{"detection":"[ \u2018etc\u2019were broadcast on Poetry Now (BBC Radio 3). ]The author[ gratefully acknowledges the help of a Scottish]","prefix":" \u2018etc\u2019were broadcast on Poetry Now (BBC Radio 3).
