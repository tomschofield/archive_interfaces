On shore round the coin-op telescope the children bounce and wrangle, and the cars slide down to the shore and slide away again. An encounter on the edge of things, the sea\u2019s curled lip, the end of a continent, the abounding other, leaving The still, head-up animals stare indifferently out of the ocean. 23 \n￼f The Flaw Greenery dresses the lake Offering reeds to the shallows; Ruinous mud-spits Finger out from the shore. Week by week the broad Water shrinks from the banks And the palmate feet of coot Leave longer tracks. A secret fissure is leaking The whole lake away, A treachery nobody knows of But the deepest of the sluggish tench. If this goes on those slow Bronze fish will find themselves Desperately flattening down Into the last wet inches^ ^ Their small gapes will round As if howling out hurt And accusation at the thin Hidden wound killing all of them. It will be no use. Something has struck Way beneath where any healing Can possibly reach. Their trust And ours will shrivel and then choke. 29 \n￼On the Bridge The water is a slate bed with raw quarry marks rippling it, solid flat and fast flowing. From here you can feel the hard breaking of anything dropping onto it, the bony crack before the splash. How far up would the ragged subsiding edge of water climb? Would the bottom strut feel any spray? How long would a body float? ^ould a mile downstream he where it is finally clawed to shore? Is this what he wonders? Chin on the balustrade too high for elbows, what is he looking at? The sick sky\u2019s lid on his world, the down-river line of rooftops, or the dead back of his eyelids, closed, blacking it all out? The wind plucks at his face. If the noticeable world sags like a wet fleece, impenetrable, cold, inwardly he is rich in pigments, theatrically lit. Instead of the drama of the long drop, a solo sprawled finale, he can retract \n￼spitefully into the prepared space under the skull, thick with images and ruled by no force he has allegiance to, not even circumstance. Foiled by the dull impossibilities, he slips deftly back inside his head/ to make it all happen there? \n￼Kafka\u2019s Funeral It should have been raining lead that Prague June. More probably, though, the sun shone instead. The sky would have been very indifferent. It was not a large gathering bunched at the graveside, silent. Max Brod, humped and intent, gave the one speech, a lament, a claim, an honouring. i_n \"trx . his books away adventuring into the real and difficult world. The distraction when it came came from that world, a woman, dark, twentjish, who broke decorum, and in the shock of a moment\u2019s numb surprise, flung hair, arms, body and passionate wailing in a wild restraining struggle over the gaping trench. Kafka\u2019s father 38 The box was ready to go, Kafka kt lastjbecominglthe mole he always felt he was, to steal along the winding tunnels of his secret castle, or to burrow as he used to, furled under his sick man\u2019s bedclothes, still and safe, and see himself sail un\u2019vntc. rested \n￼Callbox, Midnight Darkness is more than absence of light. Trees in the suburb hug themselves in fog and slide beads down their grooved bark. The telephone box beams like a Christmas candle; inside, your tears glitter and scatter tinselly over your collar. The message is muffled, coughed out, cut short as I pass. The receiver tings wittily as the door groans open to let you out. Your footsteps knock and knock fadingly away. Your black dress is swallowed by dark, by time, by catastrophe. You go off walking, walking somewhere, whatever it was, whoever you are. \n￼Bracelet That touching metal deceives; its cool smooth skin polishes skin and burnishes itself. It takes up warmth and retains it briefly thus seeming to give. Its innocent integument covers a win* heart. It plays with fugitive light catching whatever it can to dispose as its own; starlight on frost, you could say, or sun on a railway line, would not outstare it. when all is said, too near whatever truth vibrates under those invisible follicles. l^r\\ (cUspense- fL 9/ such images might be, It has its dangers^then^ for you who wear it; 41 r \n￼A Photograph of Your Friends One of your friends is in silver, the other in black: an obvious pair, slumped on a padded settle; their legs shine without fuss, their emptied glasses teeter, they are contemptuous of us. Silver\u2019s intent on the lens, Black is intent on her. Silver smiles firmly as if the lens is her bedroom mirror and her teeth secret omens. Black /s lunging to splutter a kiss on the turning jaw and test her palm along a silver thigh. For her the camera, like everything outside herself, is a minor flaw in the world, a mild aberration. There the disco sound encloses and invades with its big feel. Your friends, you claim, are vibrant, raw, you have got to say, real; this fixes one of their phases. Their eyes are flat and unexcitable. They\u2019re much like you, you say, hoping I\u2019ll think you mistaken; or partly so, for a part > o f you wants to be partly taken as living inside your own law, sublimely silver, or black and stricken. 42 ","docTitle":"","docDate":"2014-07-01 09:47:01.713"},"meta":{"contentType":"text/raw","emVer":"7.1.1103.5","langIdVer":"DefaultLangId","processingVer":"CalaisJob01","submissionDate":"2014-07-01 09:47:00.497","submitterCode":"57b17a53-6e34-87b0-20ff-a419896f49c9","signature":"digestalg-1|HpD3k2WC4VR7jS6D7by1acHVwJk=|KvORf02fH3srs7jleXfjh1emQgp86wEKgr/X6/yMERmCZ1NYWQlCsg==","language":"English"}},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/384f84a3-1131-366e-993b-c623804add06/lid/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http://d.opencalais.com/lid/DefaultLangId/English"},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/25b78536-744e-32f7-878c-6e6ccbe0dcc7":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"NaturalFeature","name":"lake Offering","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/NaturalFeature","instances":[{"detection":"[of the ocean. 23 \n￼f The Flaw Greenery dresses ]the lake Offering[ reeds to the shallows; Ruinous mud-spits Finger]","prefix":"of the ocean. 23 \n￼f The Flaw Greenery dresses ","exact":"the lake Offering","suffix":" reeds to the shallows; Ruinous mud-spits Finger","offset":626,"length":17}],"relevance":0.318},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/f0de9606-a91f-3290-8e58-29c0b3c3aeab":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"IndustryTerm","name":"metal","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/IndustryTerm","instances":[{"detection":"[was, whoever you are. \n￼Bracelet That touching ]metal[ deceives; its cool smooth skin polishes skin and]","prefix":"was, whoever you are. \n￼Bracelet That touching ","exact":"metal","suffix":" deceives; its cool smooth skin polishes skin and","offset":3877,"length":5}],"relevance":0.105},"http://d.opencalais.com/pershash-1/a0d40ccd-f033-3098-8649-b568274a3def":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"Person","name":"Max Brod","persontype":"N/A","nationality":"N/A","commonname":"Max Brod","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/Person","instances":[{"detection":"[gathering bunched at the graveside, silent. ]Max Brod[, humped and intent, gave the one speech, a]","prefix":"gathering bunched at the graveside, silent.
