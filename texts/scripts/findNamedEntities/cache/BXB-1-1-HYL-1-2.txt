My hunger is for print; his, corn in stitch, wreather\u2019s embroidery His labour is all harvested sewing unpicked, all the seasons gone for which he, his weathered face upturned, gathered intelligence XIII There is one place I know where the street smells right in Soho, a cafe where I go sometimes, where they sell the right sort of bread and where they speak my tongue among themselves. I listen with the other foreigners the English men, I sink and roll it on my tongue how sourdough sweetens! and swallow it hard my teeth in the bread \n￼XIV The priest throws back his head under the uptilted chalice Under the black of his beard his supple throat pumps As if he emptied the dome of the psalms lapping its brim And on my tongue dissolution of wafer and high seriousness The creed\u2019s sumptuous chant strangely bland but indigestible Because I think I could not give all my juices to it; flatus In the bowel lent a pained smile to the practice of holiness To him whose racked form rode the tree into whose death I could not donate Suffering so framed with pomp but I see now in retrospect Not wholly corrupt, a memory a drinking to certain hope The priest\u2019s voluptuous throat throbbing with joyous guffaws Celebrating a death and again roaring at the death of death r \n￼XV Then I was consecrated to correct economics I was a bright pupil Now with a dull eye I look out from London across foothills of brick Domes and spires diminished douched by a cataract of glass, architect\u2019s vision I had it, I saw man pinned on the drawing board in plan and elevation My tall head built of panes tears of glass sizzled on the dome of my heart Theoretical pity for the man I had seen not for me, not for me I had not yet learned that. I was a bright pupil. Now with a dull eye I creep through porticoes pitiful, not a cubit added to my stature XVI (Is it worth it this dredging up memories of the future that is long gone and that never was? W orth anything to think of the position to which ambition raised me, me and all of mankind it imagined? Since I have been put in my place probably it is worthless but it is costly) / \n￼XVII I was a saint, for love of country I left it - frontiers as are well known are imaginary and bloody\u2014my ideals in the safe custody of trustworthy comrades Like a child who\u2019s lent toys to fickle friends I fear to return What of my toys amongst the pieces they picked up the imaginary and ransacked nursery pieced together again piecemeal, beloved country ramshackle in my head I want to visit but I hesitate to go back, for good XVIII The ship I came on passport to mission iron link with home (the farewell handprint of my dead father on its starboard rail) the subtle groundswell sickness at parting embarking upon something \u2022 When I heard (from fellow-exiles I can\u2019t call comrades^ that the Vessel C*** survivor of-war by accident, had long been broken up steep deck, raucous plates all scrap, in a gust old salt stung my eyes \n￼\\ vvctors \\ C XXIX In my country we look into each other\u2019s eyes freedom has been won The vigors have given it to us \u2014if freedom is everything that is what we owe them When a man dies his son eats the bacon that cures under the dead m an\u2019s rafters The chandelier\u2019s contagion inherited by blood: the victors\u2019 heirs preserve our freedom, salt it down W e are hungry the flesh of our house whole but divided in spirit We look into each other\u2019s eyes first one way and then another first one way and then another XXX I am a puppet on very long strings length gives a certain elasticity Or I am a part of a ventriloquist\u2019s act I sit very still and keep my mouth shut I am a dummy on the knee of a cadaver \n￼XIX My sentimentality appals me then consoles; emotions still, but sudden I butter-fingered drop them and mis-feel I was a hard nut in my prime to crack a mind and body bedded snugly in well knitted joints, nothing rotten or loose But then a place grew softly where they met back of the throat, perhaps, above the heart grew large and liquid, a soft centre, sac Whose juice digests my thick skin from within and now I think my insides are all slops contained tears pent up in a fragile shell I am a hard man before breaking out I shall, if I hole myself, leak away. I am appalled, to hatch now is to die XX I do not listen much to fellow-exiles\u2019 tales of home, they must believe they are better off here since they cannot return I do not listen much because I can, but one such bitter recital nestles deep in my ear like a worm, a tale of imaginative torture - a troublesome priest penned in B*** prison, at length exhorted by a spike red hot steel up his arse on his knees to say mass over shit and piss though ordure and urine were the words the man used who told the tale, shaking I don\u2019t know if I should take his words for gospel his imagination or my lack of it, fact Facts are made up. To know from far, to remember is to daydream. Bread. Shit. To see straight in close-up an imaginative act it is best to forget \n￼XXI I have nothing to say in return missionary without a gospel lamp hid under a bushel me in this airless room! you think I\u2019ve escaped to this from the pig-pen, my trampled country or am expatriate on greener grass mixing my hopes and fears with yours my conversation is a charade I watch from under word-cover when I re-enter my homeland I shall shout hopes out loud I\u2019m no exile banished from my soil exile is my mission patriot, servant, soon I shall return till then this pencil is blunted re-sharpened, otherwise never share my fears with anyone, anywhere XXII My parents\u2019business always was well-known in the next village before ours because our clear-eyed neighbour silent M other K*** had a garrulous sister living there to whom each Sunday she\u2019d carefully walk with white eggs and take brandy in return retracing her steps with a happily empty basket just as her darling hens were cackling over their darling white eggs \n￼Prayer was often difficult the confessional was an easy route to God\u2019s ear\u2014it was his eye I feared glinting through lattice-work The presumptive photo of me was taken before my first communion crisp and black and white\u2014his eye an open shutter between prayers snapping at each new secret sin a series of mug-shots falling away from the primal image\u2014I tried to surprise myself in mirrors to find out if anything showed the complexion of my soul seeping through an aperture\u2014that his eye would scan, find wanting and write down I could not find words for my sins I repented of faith in forgiveness penance mere punishment\u2014I feared passing of notes and whispering XXIV The hospital \u2014me a boy i n a m e n \u2019s w a r d \u2014 I love the whole the real world Stethoscopes read universal tremors world of diagnoses screens dragged around trivial atrocities and unlikely cures starched sheets and disinfectant covering up I love it all the noise of life silence of death orchestrated out of control Doctors bending over listening with their instruments their smiles and for corruption their knowledge or what is not worse ignorance I love it all a museum of living sicknesses as I love England \n￼XXV In the England I love I am visitor I am listener and collector I step out stooping from the sick-room the confessional and the hen-coop W ith my stethoscope my white coat and a notebook full of symptoms With my micro-camera under my cassock with white eggs cradled in my smock XXVI W hen the air though cold hung heavily in the trees I heard a pig\u2019s scream and looked out\u2014an arena at the forest\u2019s edge where a desperate dog-wolf chased one of our young A piglet runs like a cat ears flat, stops so fast with all its trotters dug in grinning in its fear that the grey beast overruns and snarling turns back on the pale scampering thing Then it seems success turns the pig\u2019s head from terror to playfulness till its squealing is with laughter and the dog-wolf too relaxes despite hunger fangs sure then of lard Whether or not I dreamt this or saw in the flesh circus at the forest\u2019s edge when the air though cold hung heavily in the trees I heard the pig\u2019s scream bubble softly and turn red \n￼XXVII What I am does not add up then I think that always there\u2019s a big bomb in the air Plane circling abov^ england on alert ready to head east before you can blink All is in order up there precision double-checked triple-fail-safe on target Above smiling diplomats governments and people making mistakes making love I think of just one of them just one crew made one through harsh discipline conditioned Made interrogation-proof by torture dependable tools put through my paces I

not give way at my weight I am not blind I watch the faces listen to gossip corridors and closets whispers of free speech this democracy A house divided against itself \u2014eyes already clogged with coin\u2014 does not need Samson \n￼XXXI My face a professional dissident I stretch to fit the mask My heart a muscle-knot can\u2019t afford feeling acts by the method \u2014empathy disallowed\u2014 objective performance happy when the audience turns away, coughs behind its hand My head a cabinet of files each labelled Faces, Names and Places Technical Detail, Plans Political Praxis, Miscellaneous classified according to priority and secrecy W atch, listen to the audience collate designate transmit adrenalin instinct the head gathers intelligence The face knows nothing the heart knows something else \n￼XXXII W hat does the heart know it is not certain the heart is in exile and not from its soil Voltaire\u2019s tragic figure the faithless priest the heart thought it escaped God and his trappings left home for the night like my grown sisters carrying their smart shoes as far as the road lodging boots in the hedge against their return the heart has grown up twice faithless atheist Materialism & History are not enough I want more I want more the hungry heart I know about hunger when there is no food but no, not when there is no such thing as food \n￼XXXIII Lately, perhaps because I soon shall cross it for the last time, I have been tripping to the sea And what seems like a mote troubles my eye a man\u2019s head floating far out, fighting with the sea Imaginary and bloody frontier - stones, fine red fronds like hands\u2019veins in the sea Unaccounted-for corpuscles per cubic metre and only great mammals warming the dilute blood of the sea I pick up soft pebbles of chalk, sculpture burrowed-in, bored-through, dense with the dead of the sea My size is embarrassing suddenly, my pride - what do I know of the creaturely galaxies in the sea And what of the man I imagine far out, trampled in the waves\u2019charge, drowning in the sea I know nothing, I turn back to the low cliffs their dirty-red and grey houses blindly looking out to sea And I think I throw my shoes off and dive in a good socialist or a bourgeois hero by the sea My victim does not appreciate the difference I buoy him up, he cries Save me, save me from the sea \n￼XXXIV Soon I shall board a plane and fly from one language to another. It will take a part of a day I shall fly from English even from these poems back to my tongue. I still think of it in that way All my intelligence flew that route under wraps and waits for me. There I\u2019ll be day by day by day Transmitted, translated back in time to the tongue I was taught in. The thrill of seeing, then, one way Before that, older games of dreams and sense and faith long forgotten. My skill with each word a new toy I\u2019ll think of my poems this intelligence in my other tongue. I will not be a sad old boy \n￼XXXV I am flying to my homeland I will not be a sad old boy My father is long dead I will not be a sad old boy My mother is dead also I will not be a sad old boy My sisters are still alive I will not be a sad old boy My wife is not any more I will not be a sad old boy My work is over and done with I will not be a sad old boy My time is up it is too late I will not be a sad old boy My time is my own I will not be a sad old boy What time? I will not be a sad old boy I\u2019ve been saying it over and over like a charm, a strong charm repeated under a waxing moon or litany, endless litany chanted to ward off the devil or a prayer, a heart-felt prayer a begging letter XXXVI (Fortunately from an objective viewpoint I am unimportant I serve the state a people\u2019s monk an eye on a stalk my feelings and my fate the last things I should think about I look out for the rest why worry them with my hope and guilt I am unimportant it takes so many m e\u2019s to make a mass) \n￼XXXVH I have not mentioned it yet \u2014a man in my position has to be discreet with women\u2014 but since I left my wife behind a succession of at best brief happinesses has dogged me I think of my mother and father. My eyes have known more than theirs but seem to see less. I do not wonder at my heaviness. Eyes\u2019saturated humours precipitate a callus on the nerve that only tears can solve. However tenderly it was done it has all been snatched and stashed in the memory. Nothing was made. Now I want to make it up with somebody, in my tongue, at home XXXVIII W hat shall I say now with this English tongue cut out of my head (M*** whom we though lost came back from the dead from the fascists\u2019 hands He had lost his tongue. They had translated him into a fool forgetting how well fools are listened to, his eloquent hands muscles at his tongue\u2019s root fought with the air in his open mouth a crock at the end of an arc of blood. We cried out for him) I have not suffered not really, I am it seems in one piece and if we\u2019re careful my friend, professor at S***, will translate all this, this false start back into my tongue. I may find my tongue \n￼XXXIX During the war\u2014 men at men\u2019s throats \u2014how we trusted our poor neighbours we thought we knew wrho our friends were So I\u2019ll propose a special vote of thanks to friends here in England for trusting me\u2014 here\u2019s to neighbours! Do not disturb was my watchword\u2014 if he\u2019ll forgive a spy\u2019s foibles I\u2019ll forgive the drunkard next door Leave him in peace XL On leaving shall I pronounce as retiring episkopos benediction on my diocese? Shall I quote Jesus, My peace I leave with you? I would not bequeath my whatever it is to a dog In peace is passive enough, your choice. Peace does not belong to me I am going home to look for it Shall I quote the prodigal, Father I have sinned?
