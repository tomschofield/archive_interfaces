And she: explaining in her clean French, in a creaking room of the musee Carnavalet, that in those days There were two currencies: one for Paris And another for France (which is to say Not Paris) and these two were exchanged Under this table on that bridge over the filthy Seine - which one could see had not changed... And I: grappling with rates of conversion In broken English, picture the bridge At Naunton, sucking this smooth Gift of green and gold into its mouth, And the slipping sky, to spew it back Out the other side in rucked black And silver - consider this a fair Exchange, but hardly the same river. e / 17 ","docTitle":"","docDate":"1991-07-29"},"meta":{"contentType":"text/raw","emVer":"7.1.1103.5","langIdVer":"DefaultLangId","processingVer":"CalaisJob01","submissionDate":"2014-07-01 08:48:43.282","submitterCode":"57b17a53-6e34-87b0-20ff-a419896f49c9","signature":"digestalg-1|RHo33AGdRuLU8jdIXMRqFU1+kbQ=|JfWsxsa95dlr0OvDIcWH7XiTOXw51LMm0wYdulaOshW805I3/FPARg==","language":"English"}},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/5aac058a-547a-308e-b12d-8c1ae8adb008/cat/1":{"_typeGroup":"topics","category":"http://d.opencalais.com/cat/Calais/Hospitality_Recreation","classifierName":"Calais","categoryName":"Hospitality_Recreation","score":0.657},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/5aac058a-547a-308e-b12d-8c1ae8adb008/lid/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http://d.opencalais.com/lid/DefaultLangId/English"},"http://d.opencalais.com/comphash-1/dddc8d92-72f0-377a-a86e-44a693ff990a":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"Company","name":"Garrett","nationality":"N/A","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/Company","instances":[{"detection":"[ ￼]Garrett[ 29/7/91 10:02 am Page 17 Pont Au Change: Two]","prefix":" ￼","exact":"Garrett","suffix":" 29/7/91 10:02 am Page 17 Pont Au Change: Two","offset":2,"length":7}],"relevance":0.417,"resolutions":[{"id":"http://d.opencalais.com/er/company/ralg-tr1r/471edc60-4ad5-3c44-98cd-91007a475500","score":1,"name":"GARRETT COMMUNICATIONS INC","shortname":"GARRETT"}]},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/56fc901f-59a3-3278-addc-b0fc69b283e7":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"City","name":"Paris","resolutions":[{"id":"http://d.opencalais.com/er/geo/city/ralg-geo1/797c999a-d455-520d-e5cf-04ca7fb255c1","name":"Paris,France","shortname":"Paris","containedbycountry":"France","latitude":"48.8742","longitude":"2.346954"}],"_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/City","instances":[{"detection":"[And another for France (which is to say Not ]Paris[) and these two were exchanged Under this table]","prefix":"And another for France (which is to say Not ","exact":"Paris","suffix":") and these two were exchanged Under this table","offset":360,"length":5}],"relevance":0.372},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/e1fd0a20-f464-39be-a88f-25038cc7f50c":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"Country","name":"France","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/Country","instances":[{"detection":"[two currencies: one for Paris And another for ]France[ (which is to say Not Paris) and these two were]","prefix":"two currencies: one for Paris And another for ","exact":"France","suffix":" (which is to say Not Paris) and these two were","offset":332,"length":6}],"relevance":0.372,"resolutions":[{"id":"http://d.opencalais.com/er/geo/country/ralg-geo1/e165d4f2-174b-66a7-d1a9-5cb204d296eb","name":"France","latitude":"46.0","longitude":"2.0"}]},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/2cdc0cb9-ecf8-3038-b930-bcc6d4e75773":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"Facility","name":"bridge At Naunton","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/Facility","instances":[{"detection":"[of conversion In broken English, picture the ]bridge At Naunton[, sucking this smooth Gift of green and gold into]","prefix":"of conversion In broken English, picture the ","exact":"bridge At Naunton","suffix":", sucking this smooth Gift of green and gold into","offset":564,"length":17}],"relevance":0.372}}
