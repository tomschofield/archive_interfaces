Garlanded Cytherea troubles them all. Against three of her own kind it is true she is powerless: Against clear-eyed Athene for one, the daughter of Black Zeus. She is indifferent to love And delights in discord and warfare, the works o f Ares; But also in the manufacturing of fine things. She first taught earth\u2019s craftsmen the making O f war-q^iriots in intricate bronze And young girls the management of the house\u2014all Beautiful works of their hands come from her teaching. Nor can the huntress Artemis, armed with golden Arrows, ever be subjugated by Aphrodite, The lover of laughter. For she loves archery, The hounding to death of animals on mountains, The clamour of pursuit in dark forests; but also They lyre, dance and the rule of civil law. Finally the virgin Hestia cares nothing for The works of Aphrodite. Strangely born The first and youngest child of cunning Kronos She steadfastly refujsed Apollo and Poseidon Who wanted her in marriage. On the head of Zeus She swore to live her immortal life a virgin: She had great honour from Zeus instead of marriage. She has her place in the middle of the house, The best portions are hers. In all the temples She is reverenced. None of the immortals Is more highly thought of by mortal men. These Aphrodite cannot sway. Otherwise not one Among the blessed gods nor any man Has ever eluded her. She distracts the mind \n￼/ Even of Zeus to whom the thunder is A plaything and whose maj^ty is greatest. She overcomes his wisdom whenever she likes And easily brings him to bed with mortal women Deceiving Hera his sister and his wife The first in beauty among the immortal goddesses, Born of Rhea and Kronos, the trustworthy Consort of Zeus whose wisdom is endless. And he caused Aphrodite herself to want Union with a mortal man, for so long As she remained innocent of human love Among the immortals she could always point the finger At their having been joined in love by her, The laughter-loving Aphrodite, gods With mortal women who bore them sons of death And goddesses in love with mortal men. He made her love Anchises, at that time A herdsman on the steep slopes of ida, The mountain of innumerable streams, and like A god in looks. She loved him immediately. Desire took hold of smiling Aphrodite As soon as she saw the man. She went to Cyprus, To Paphos where her precinct and altar are, Into her fragrant house. The shining doors Being closed, she was bathed by the Charities And anointed with an oil she had that the gods Perfume themselves with. She clothed her body In beautiful clothes and put on gold for ornament And laughing she left fragrant Cyprus And flew to Troy through the high clouds Quickly making her way. So she came To Ida of the innumerable streams and mother of wild beasts and went at once ;T To the shying across the mountain. After her, Fawning upon her, came grey wolves and fierce lions, / Bears and the fast deer-hunting le/pards. It pleased her to see them and she'made Them lust, so that they coupled in the shadowy combes. But she herself came to the hill farm 88 \n￼And found him alone there, his companions being out, Anchises whose beauty was from the gods. His companions were following the herds over the pastures _and he was quite alone in the house Wandering here and there and strumming on a lyre. Aphrodite, daughter of Zeus, she stood Before him, like a virgin girl in appearance, So that when he saw her he should not be afraid: But still he was amazed, for she was tall and imposing. He stared at her shining clothes. She wore A peplos brighter than the brightness of fire, Golden, beautifully worked, that shimmered Like moonlight over her soft breasts, and this Astounded him, and the twisted brooches, ear-rings Like calyxes and, lovelier than anything he had ever seen, Necklaces on her white throat. Then love Took Anchises hold. He said: \u2018Welcome, Lady, to my house, whichever one you are O f the immortals, whether Artemis or Leto or Golden Aphrodite or Themis or bright-eyed Athene, or perhaps you are one of the Graces Who are companions to the gods and are called immortal, Or one of the Nymphs who inhabit the pleasant woods Or one whose places are this lovely mountain And where the rivers start and these grasy meadows. I will make you an altar on a high peak Where it may be seen for miles around and in all Seasons offer sacrifices. You Be kindly disposed and grant me eminence Among the Trojans and strong sons for the future And let me live long in the daylight Prosperous among my people as I age.\u2019 / Aphrodite, the child of Zeus, replied: \u2018jmchises, second to none in fame among mortal men, I am not a goddess, why did you think me one? A mortal mother bore me to die as you will. My father is Otreus, you will have heard of him, He rules Phrygia with its many fortresses. But I know your language as well as my own For my nurse was a Trojan. She raised me \n￼From infancy, in lieu of my dear mother. Now Hermes, Killer of Argus, Bearer of The Golden Wand, has snatched me from the dance O f Artemis the Huntress with the golden arrows Where we were playing together, nymphs And marriageable girls and a crowd surrounding us. Then Hermes snatched me from among them And carried me over many tilled fields And over much land owned by no-one and untilled Where savage beasts stalk in the shadowy combes Until I thought I should never again set foot On the good earth. And he said I should be The wife o f Anchises and bear you beautiful children, And having said so he, Hermes, withdrew Among the deathless gods and I have come To you, bound by necessity. By Zeus I beg you now and by your noble parents - For noble they must be to have a son like you - Take me, a virgin and ignorant of love, And show me to your father and mother .and to your brothers, that they may judge what sort Of wife I shall make you, and send quickly To the Phrygians, whose horses go like the wind, To tell my father and my grieving mother, And they will send you quantities of gold And woven clothes. Accept these many gifts As my dowry. Then let us be married since We wish it and heaven and earth approve.\u2019 Concluding, the goddess touched him to the heart With love and desire for her. Anchises said: \u2018If you are mortal and born of a mortal woman And Otreus, whom I have heard of, is your father As you say, and you have come here by the will Of Hermes, the Wayfarer, to be my wife Lifelong, nobody human or divine Shall keep me from lying with you here and now, No, not if Apollo the Archer himself Let fly arrows at me from his silver bow, 0 Lady beautiful as a goddess, from your bed 1 would not mind going down to Hades\u2019 house. He took her hand. Then smiling Aphrodite / \n￼Averting her face and with her eyes cast down Went slowly to the bed that was already laid For the royal man with soft coverings, with The skins of bears and o f loud-roaring lions Killed by him on the high mountains. And when They were together on the bed he first Removed the jewellery from her body, Unfastened her dress at the shoulders, undid The twisted broches, the ear-rings, the necklaces, Loosed her belt and so one by one Took off her shining clothes and laid them Down on a silver-studded chair. Thus ignorant Of what he did, by the will of the gods and fated, He lay, a mortal man, with a deathless goddess. But at the hour when the herdsmen drive the cattle And sheep home into the fold from the flowery pastures Aphrodite caused Anchises to sleep sweetly But she dressed in her fine clothes again And fully clo(h)jied stood by the bed tall As the roof now and her face radiant with the beauty Only the immortals have, and among them only Cytherea. Then she woke him saying: \u2018Dardanus\u2019 son I wonder what you are dreaming, look now Whether I am as you first saw me.\u2019 He heard her and woke at once, but when He saw the throat and lovely eyes of Aphrodite Then he was afraid and averted his eyes and hid His face\u2014that she found beautiful\u2014in his cloak Entreating her so: \u2018when I first saw you, goddess, I knew you for what you are, though you denied it. But now by implacable Zeus I beg you Do not leave me like one of the dead among The living. H^fe mercy. I know the very life Leaves a mortal man who has slept with a goddess.\u2019 Aphrodite, daughter of Zeus, replied: \u2018Anchises, best of men, be reassured And on that score not too fearful. Nothing Harmful will happen to you either from me Or from the other gods. You will be loved. 91 \n￼You will have a son who will be dear to you and me. He will be king among the Trojans, and children Upon children will continue your family for ever. He will be called Aeneas, on account of the grief It gives me to have slept with a mortal man Though among such your family has always Approached nearest the immortal gods in looks. Did not Zeus, despite his wisdom, carry off Golden-haired Ganymedes for his beauty To be among the immortals and pour them Their drink, drawing the red nectar From a golden bowl? They held him in honour And wonder. Tros however was inconsolable Not knowing where the whirlwind from heaven Had carried his dear son whom day in, day out, He mourned. Then Zeus took pity, and paid him Compensation for the boy in the form of high- Stepping horses\u2014such as carry the immortals. And with this gift Hermes, obeying Zeus, Explained all and said the boy would neither Die nor age but be like the gods. At this Tros left off weeping and turned to rejoicing And rode his stormy horses with a glad heart. And Eos too, thro^ned in gold, tookj^. up Another of your race, Tithonus, also In appearance like the deathless gods and asked The cloudly son of Kronos that he should Live for ever. Zeus assented. She had her wish, Poor fool, who never thought to get him besides Eternal life eternal youth and total Remission of old age. Thus in the flower Of his life he lived like one of the blessed With the young and golden Eos by Ocean\u2019s Streams at the world\u2019s end\u2014until grey showed In his hair and beard, marring their beauty. Then Eos the Queen never came to his bed But still kept him in her house and saw To him with food and ambrosia and fine clothes until Foul old age overwhelmed him and he Was helpless to raise or move his limbs. \n￼Then she thought best to lay him in a room And to close the bright doors on him and there He babbles on for ever and cannot lift A finger, who was formerly lithe and strong. I would not like you to be, after his fashion, Not able to die among the deathless gods. I should not like you for a husband in heaven when Old age, common to all men, ruthless age, The curse, the burden, that the gods shudder at, Has enshrouded you. And even were you to live Unaging and as you are now in looks Still I should be ashamed eternally Among the immortals because of you. For they Were afraid of me who mated them all By cunning with mortal men and women and laughed At them and they were all subject to me. But now who am I to speak having erred Outrageously and taken leave of my senses And got myself with child by a mortal man? When he first sees the light of the sun let him Be given into the care of the nymphs who inhabit This great and holy mountain, for in nature They are between mortals and gods. Thelive long And eat heavenly food and dance the lovely Dance with the gods and goddesses and with them Sileni and Hermes himself, the sharp-eyed Killer of Argus, go into the dark places O f pleasant caves to lie down together in love. And at their birth pines or high oaks spring up With them on the nurturing earth, beautiful, tall And flourishing trees on the high mountains. They______ Would ever lop them with an axe. But when The nymphs are fated to die and death is close Then first those beautiful trees wither where they stand, The bark dies on them, the twigs fall and the souls O f the trees and o f the nymphs leave the sunlight Together. These nymphs will have the custody of my son During his infancy, but when he begins his boyhood Then, once, they will show him to you here. Later, \n￼About the fifth year, I shall bring him to you again And what I intend will be made clear. He will be lovely then, he will be like A god, and a joy to you. Bring him immediately To windy Troy and remember if any ask Who bore you such a son say this: that he Was born of one of the flowerlike nymphs who inhabit This wooded hill. But if, like a fool, You boast of loving and lying with Cypris, The crowned queen, Zeus in rage will blast you With fire. Now I have said all I shall say. Be warned. Never name me. Fear the gods.\u2019 She rose then on the winds of heaven. Farewell Goddess, Queen of well-built Cyprus, With you I began, with you I shall continue.
