Sweetest hour. But what if between our gazes shadows o f the stricken fa ll, the stares we seem to veil keep on commanding us? Our two-ness is never alone. Whose is that intrusive face that looms unseen between us condemning all we haven\u2019t done? The eclipsed. The destitute. 0 sly worm o f dominance coiling its own discountenance, our masks and blottings out. Is love a threadbare blindfold?

And fruits: plums, tangerines, seedy moon of a kiwi, yellow-orange flesh of mangos, children of the barrio, how can I explain? Or cheeses skinned with peppers, a stilton waxy, wrinkle-rinded, my blue-veined gorgonzolas. W hen the tim e com es, how will we have been? M orning curtains, towels lilac and green in the light, the pile of a rug scuffing toes, children of the barrio, how can I explain? Something cries its grievance.

Every morning for months I watched a man I might have been, about my age and bearded too, his face blotched crimson with cheap wine and sleeping rough. He walked the far side of the street always hurrying somewhere; a father who couldn\u2019t praise, I wondered, or what had blurred his star? For months our eyes never met, though the street between us was narrow, until that eve he crossed. \u2018Some help,\u2019 he said, but it must have been my double\u2019s eyes that asked where would He lie down tomorrow? An old outsider within me winced, shook him off and fled; that street between was so narrow - I chose the inn and was afraid. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve never seen him since - but tomorrow when carafes go round a lone presence will pass tremors through our frail togetherness; again those eyes will ask where did last night\u2019s Christ lie down? 28 \n￼0' Siadhail 9-46 5/7/95 4:24 pm Page, f <J\\ Tables 1 \u2018You know yourself, nothing but money counts.\u2019 I try my best to smile my knowing smile. Nods to an age\u2019s spirit, a self-effacement. So often he\u2019s the enabler, a hidden hand lent. \u2018On bread alone?\u2019 But any doubt is scandal. I swallow mutinous words as the tables turn. W hat did I ever know of deprivation? His scorn whips me: shame, insecurity, angst that haunts a body all its life. Nothing. I know nothing. Self-made, yet so many taken under his wing. Even innocence must sometimes wear a mask. \u2018That\u2019s talk for Reties or the too well-off!\u2019 2 An ascetic? No. A mortal who loves to eat sharon fruits, blancmange, to sip iced rose or feel warm sand on the arches of his feet. Young Keats dressed and quiffed for his table. I bath early, grooming and scenting myself; silked and rakish, I\u2019m ready to love invisible muses. Then everything cloys except the journey. Endless desert. I feed on some hump of memory and expectation. Ecstasy moving and stationary, a delight fuelling itself. U nlim ited supply and demand. The end of desire is more desire.

(W ho\u2019ll shelter my double?) I tuck my knee-caps into the hollows of her knees. And still he haunts me, my vagabond counterpart. I know Thomas More brought beggars to his table. Every loop of the mind I try keeps falling short. So much dereliction I know I can\u2019t countenance. Justice is a faceless scales. Tell me who\u2019ll be the rich man sighting that prodigal in the distance to fall on his neck and kiss him? The love cup raised in celebration of a father\u2019s huge abandon; the art of giving, the art of never giving up. 30 \n￼O'Siadhail 9-46 5/7/95 4:24 pm Page Hostel Station of ease for the broken or frail. A tear in an ocean. And yet that welcome At face value, a roof and warmth, a meal. Vague signals of angeldom. So little. So short of grand revolution We\u2019ll always want to dream of. If only dreams could scoop or fill an ocean... Thimbled gestures of a love, Some gift of falling for endless tasks Berth this moment\u2019s care; The scarred visage of a down-and-out who asks I f an ocean starts with a tear? Patient logs of strays and have-nots. A youth stubborn and hurt Uproots and wanders. No one knows his whereabouts, Nomad and introvert. Long headstrong years on the loose; Now shattered and underfed A quarrelsome body yields nightly to delicious Mercies of bath and bed. One evening and again he\u2019s gone W ithout trace.

A caress on the face of the earth. / 31 \n￼O'Siadhail 9-46 5/7/95 4:24 pm Page Theft Another wired photograph of an African woman Holding a small girl with a pear-shaped head And a shrivelled crowfooted face. Has someone Thieved a child, left her this elf instead? Drought. Failed crops. And the rains too late. Hollows of famine rumble the bowels of the earth. Look long and deep. Unable to clean forget, I begin my day, busy in the lap of the north. Little knoweth the fa t what the lean doth mean. I can\u2019t ghost-write a suffering. Only my guess And leap, flickers of memory or the unforeseen. I know how easily a world unsheathes my tinyness. But nothing appeases her stare. Again I\u2019ll pore Over this image of hunger. Is compassion a guilty Fear of there butforfortune or is there more? It\u2019s as though something in her gaze commands me. A look both rapt and implacable. There\u2019s no wool To pull over these eyes. Look long. Look deeper. Cycles of dominance; a hemisphere\u2019s rise and fall. She stares and stares. Am I my sister\u2019s keeper? 32 \n￼O'Siadhail 9-46 5/7/95 4:24 pm Page Two After Dark 1 I tuned in that night to a man\u2019s ageing voice: \u2018I\u2019m fancy-free. I could have had my pick of them .\u2019 An eavesdropper, had I already begun to pity him? \u2018Maybe if you\u2019re tethered young, you get used to it. All you needed was the gab and a good way with you. On the dance-floor I was as smart as any on my feet. \u2018Out there with a steady, if I saw a handsomer woman I\u2019d watch my chance. But haven\u2019t you a girl with you? It\u2019syou I want, I\u2019d say, and sure don\u2019t mind anyone. \u2019 I stare at a wireless trying to envisage his face. \u2018And I did a great trade in women from far and near.\u2019 An old notched gun smoking stubbornly in the corner. I remembered sitting in half-light with an old friend 1/ M knew I\u2019d heard her hearing my unasked question. \u2018I waited,\u2019 she laughed, \u2018for a prince to come riding \u2019on a white horse.\u2019 Always one of us, she\u2019d refused to flatter or fawn; confidante and equal in everything. A nature that had to give all. Why anything less? She used to say \u2018Wait till I\u2019m minister for fairness!\u2019 Just wait. That was a time when we owned the world. Men. Where will they all fade with their giddiness? No prince. She rose, making her way across the dark to a lamp, luminous and surefooted in her apartness.

I see him there shame-faced, glad of a let-out, As hunching on his oars he turned and back-tracked, Sullen but somehow holding his maleness intact, Frail dignity balanced on the keel of a boat. Come clean. What is it we\u2019ve been so afraid of? A fear of what we couldn\u2019t tame, wild otherness W obbling and ungraspable, a sway and completeness. We row an unfathomable sea. Comber and trough. Tumble and come-back. A filling tide\u2019s action And passivity, slow logic of retreats and charges, As wave into wave keeps gaining on itself, surges Beyond our control and so full of direction. But something in her expression is veiled and denied. Those old patterns of huff, guilt and climb-down. The ghosts of so many women are standing alone Waving to an oarsman brooding on his phantom pride. Is the boat in the bay cradling a dread of failure, A bravado trying to face up to its loss of face? Visible and invisible as children cribbing disgrace Behind our fingers, forgive us as we row ashore. 34 \n￼0 0'Siadhail 9-46 5/7/95 4:24 pm Page0 At the Hairdresser\u2019s M y neck on the porcelain rim , a tautness unbends Backwards into suds and rushes and squirts of water. A teenage girl (she could easily be my daughter) Gentles my head. Surely a world is safe in her hands? Through the steamy towels and scissorings a radio Blurts news from the East. Some million men dug in. Our sly litany, old stealthy dream of domination: Silkworm, jaguar, tomcat, hawkeye, sea-sparrow. Her thumbs spiral deep into a skull of memory. Sully\u2019s and Quinner\u2019s gangs fight for a school fort With hedgejlguttings bound into whips. Lash and hurt And threat of \u2018sissy\u2019 or \u2018coward\u2019. Above all, don\u2019t cry.
