And still I\u2019m on the outside looking in. Ouvrefmoi Ta porte pour que je puisse te revoir. *** Douai, Cambrai, Ecourt, Rumaucourt. It is not names that change or disappear, But faces and their features, like a rumour Tongues and time pull out of shape. Here I can turn my back on the unanswered door, Knowing who stands behind, my hand light On the latch to lift and open, ready to show Me round, knowing my way in, as out, By heart, a journey of the blood, the slow Footfall of diastole and systole through the night. *** Turning back, I leave things as I found them: Place in its pot the bright geranium, By the door in a yard at the heart of Rumaucourt, Between Douai, Cambrai, the Pas de Calais and the Nord, In the crease of a map scuffed blank by endless folding. Only the map o f the blood I \u2019ll keep, to tuck In here, and here; the spacious holdings O f the head; the heart\u2019s soft ruck. ■e- t 35 \n￼Riddle I am the difficult silk that slides from your grasp, I am lace petticoats and the knee-high swirl, I am an old sea-captain\u2019s white moustache, I am the perm that will not hold its curl, I am the land\u2019s dropped slip and rising shift, I am a piece of froth, a bagatelle, I am relinquishment and eternal theft, I am a gesture of greeting and farewell. \n￼GarretC 30/7/91 5:59 pm Page 37 Lost Property Kneel, and let us pray for the departed: A sulphurous incense chokes the station vaults, A pigeon coughs; the platform is deserted. Guilty-eyed, while others slept in prayer I scoured the hassock\u2019s cross-stitch for some fault As though it were my soul; and found none there. A labour of devotion: pious kisses Smothering the cushion where my knees Grew numb and bore the imprint of those stitches, Burden of the Cross. A priest intones, Feet shuffle for Communion to ease The weight, and catch the last train home. The rails are silent, empty as the aisle When rush-hour\u2019s past. A platform sweeper brushes Up confetti into piles. It\u2019s growing dark. A thin girl stands and watches As he sweeps the crumbs that drowsy birds Have missed. I wake. And there are words For this; but none so fittingly expressed As by my own hand cupped around my breast. 0 37 t -e- \n￼30/7/91 6:11 pm Page 63 Impostor Don\u2019t think that I don\u2019t know your games, You understudy muse, with your acrostic Heart and chiffon soul - slick Gloss on bloodless lips. I do. I know the closet where You lock your anagramatising mind, Word-flowers, word-animals With pop-in legs and petals. How, in the dark you take them out, Your poets, one by one, and count Them; tucking each bauble back Bright-brittle, in Christmas wrapping. And Oh when you hang them on your tree. Save on some branch a place for me - ' Sweet victim - your cutest fairy: And I shall honour you with such Howls as would haul black hags And matted beasts from their lairs, Dragging the reins of your blonde hair, Bare on the bare back of nightmare. That\u2019s how we play. No six to start, No lies, no honesty. Only the heart With its four black holes - See? There are no rules. Now hand me that key. \n￼Garrett 29/7/91 10:14 am Page 64 History Goes to Work The soft-boiled egg is emptied But makes a humpty-dumpty head Reversed. Numbskull! Bald pate! You know the spoon\u2019s importunate Knock knock will wake the dead. The silver spoon lies on its back And spoons the room all up - Side-down but never spills a drop: The ovoid walls adapt their laws And never show a crack. The egg lies in the silver spoon And yok^less words lie on the tongue And all that\u2019s in the spoon-shaped room Swears it is square; no books Were cooked. The egg is done. Remorse rests in its velvet drawer Lapped in the sleep of metaphor, The soul rests in the open palm And will not put its shell back on, And calmly waits for more. , ft /k 64 © ","docTitle":"","docDate":"1991-07-30"},"meta":{"contentType":"text/raw","emVer":"7.1.1103.5","langIdVer":"DefaultLangId","processingVer":"CalaisJob01","submissionDate":"2014-07-01 08:50:29.884","submitterCode":"57b17a53-6e34-87b0-20ff-a419896f49c9","signature":"digestalg-1|Jn6qByRfNn1mcvY2GbEqzdNIkOQ=|Vjkx/Sp9GqY7dq1k1pINSbKyXMgN8n+8TsRQXr9UrqnnnyFia7Siqg==","language":"English"}},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/3221b165-cf28-3fa4-ad10-a75ef1125409/lid/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http://d.opencalais.com/lid/DefaultLangId/English"},"http://d.opencalais.com/comphash-1/dddc8d92-72f0-377a-a86e-44a693ff990a":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"Company","name":"Garrett","nationality":"N/A","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/Company","instances":[{"detection":"[ ￼]Garrett[ 30/7/91 5:59 pin Page 35 The gate, the yard, the]","prefix":" ￼","exact":"Garrett","suffix":" 30/7/91 5:59 pin Page 35 The gate, the yard, the","offset":2,"length":7},{"detection":"[ See?
