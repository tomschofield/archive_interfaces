In the zoo gardens Gas lamps glimmer in the first rain, Slow figures pull their dark coats closer. By the bridge the puddles are slate grey, Rain hisses gently on the river, The sounds stay close to the water. In their enclosure The animals skitter and bleat, They don\u2019t appreciate Autumn's melancholic hunger. The ongoing tug of the rain, They are hungry or tired or in pain. I am not any of these things, My name is shallow and no pools form I wait for a while at the rail, I lean down and my coat falls open, The animals do not seem Touched by anything, but I hear The watchtick heart in your mouth Telling of wet leaves And the black weather to come, The colours of air. \n￼Potsdamer Platz, Berlin The comers of the world moved close After the wall Fell and was flattened and filled, People dared to walk In the wide streets and the empty places. Potsdamer, where an old man stumbled to a seat In the weeds, Potsdamer Platz where they will ^_Build and lose a world. Point by point a shape emerges, The blocky offices, flawless, linear, Behind the old memorial church with its Bombed spire That I admire because it Fails to please, ^Because it hangs out human memory In the breeze, \u2014_. fBecause it grieves. Clean glass heals the open stone, The markets drip jewellery, Silver bands and candles, hats, And over Spandauer Strasse The statues standing out against the dusk Sing of the wide streets and empty places, Of Potsdamer Platz where they will build, Two years after the wall Fell and was lifted and filled, With hardly a scar, the tar tissue knitted so well, I stand for the last time in a place Wide as the space a man's life takes to fill. \n￼Facts About Water Be ready for the flood, they said. I gathered my skirts. No flood came. Beware the danger that comes with a man, They said. I waited for the fall. In blinding light He stumbled to us from the stones. Was this the man? He fell at our feet, Fire, famine, flood. Give him his name, they said. I was drawn to the man, I told him This is your name, and then he was all I saw, The first I knew of endless, immeasurable calm, The whole struggle over and done. I had expected pain, instead He treated me with care, folding and wrapping, I had never been given before. He gave me to myself, said without saying Love if you will, but be warned, I have very little. Here was a man without the anchor of dreams. He blinked in the sun, he hardly seemed At home in his set of bones. I felt his uncontrol Reined in with a shaky hand. I said, If you need me in the night call out. Trains run beneath my house. His flame flickered, but did not go out, I conjured a green field to steady him, No gate, no way in or out, But a cool mile of young grass And four spare dry stone walls To hold him in. I had never held anyone in before. In return, he brought me to his shore, He wrote in the sand Facts about water. Minim, fathom, barrel, cord, Magnum, gallon, jeroboam. He said, when you wake far out, Dream a boat, and with these things Make good your return, and he wrote: Sextant, compass, dipstick, dial, Plumb, octant, nautical mile. He left me sleeping, I woke without fear, In a rigged vessel, sails and mast, I dreamed my way to dry land, Acre, arpent, section, square, League, light-year, township, are. \n￼Paddington The taxis line up in the sooty air, I wait for a later train. Above us all a net is cast in the gloom It hangs above the clocks you can hardly see For grime. They have given up the struggle, They wander in time as the platforms thicken And grow lean, I wish I were not this faint dishevelled me With the stoppable heart, always an eye out For the leap of light, The shaft of yellow I turn from, Healed for a spell. The sun is red, The ordinary lives Are running out on narrow rails, The engine growls at the rear, I stop my ears, I turn from the snub end of the beast, Ashamed that the sound Can so dismantle my peace of mind. I look to the three arches for black grace, A sense of light coming apart And coming together, up in the birdnote rafters The organ-music heights; I think I have to climb down, get on a train, \n￼Fall We sit over Indian bones And over the silent, Sitting up, Buried ones. Bob Hass laughs about Dickinson And tells us it is Okay to be slow And confusion is all part of what is Meant to be. I finger the silence that follows A poem\u2019s end. It is the sound Of having been there, the hard despair That follows Pain getting words And after rain You can hear the drops Staying in the trees. Sometimes the day tumbles early But coming up from the Mining Circle The grass yearns down To the figure of a girl In bronze Green as rain, and such bewilderment Is part of what is Meant to be. / \n￼He Isn't There She is a single note of the song W ithout him; she gets it wrong, The blood stops going to her head, She sees stars. She almost gets run over W ithout him; into rush-hour's cars She steps out, thinking of His forearm's blond hairs, His slenderness. Everything has a ghost Every spirit has a double Her lost half cries out for its Lost other. She senses trouble At the source, tries to block out The wrong sounds, the noise, the noise, JWas that his quiet voice? She opens her mouth But without him no sound comes out. She stands in the traffic Crying in cold air her single note And he isn't there. \n￼Heartbreak Hour His flat is all Oasis, warmth of books, He gives me tea And offers the missing piece Of a picture: Low skies and a lake iced-over, I tell him about Love's quavering note, He says there will always be A man's hand cupping my chin, Look to the light, he says, All ice is thin. Leaving there at four, heartbreak hour, The air is freezing over And the blind animals Fretting in the small of my heart Are begging me To write the stories of ice and fire, The journal of leaving behind Oases, and facing The solid grey door And my own walls, my silences. \n￼The Road to the Interior I thought I would drive To the end of the sky To the land's end. The day was naked blue The air pearl yellow All colours were fast I gunned into the afternoon As though it were my last The fear lay sideways on my heart I got so thin The bones shivered beneath my dress I held a prayer between tongue and cheek - 1used to believe - 1used to believe Everywhere stones rolled over their holes Blotting out sound The car thumped on the dirt track And swung to a halt I longed for the sun on wet grass An end to this dust, from which Nothing would rise up. My head rested on the wheel And in my dream Friends came forward to take my hands But I looked too hard to see them. \n￼Patience A game of patience The cards tap on the flat Table-top; it is late, I keep my letters tucked Down between the flower pot And night; marry the gentleman You met in the gallery, they say, Live like we do, be happy, And write back without delay. I shuffle the cards, Life is not dealt straight, The King has left his Queen - He poured the fire that lit her crown And when he left she let herself go out. She sat down. Memory pulls on its chains, I find a place Near the end, my wishes are weightless, I lay the cards On the rough table-top, they stir dust, The motes set up a thin cry. Her kingdom in flames By her red King the Queen is laid, Heart, heart, diamond, spade. \n￼In his room Inside his room, life was A balancing of weights It was a memorable sight - All that man, Contained, And those who called him mad Trawled that word from their shallow hearts, Yet, spine-arched, their napes too W ere resting lightly on the truth. I first saw him as I swam up-stream He burned bridges His face took the river colours He was one who lived perpetual spring, When he turned after rain, When he let the leaves be blown, That was unknowing, And I too lost time, growing with him, Became a changeless thing. Like smoked-out rabbits, Ears back, We fled the tums, Of tide, of season, of the day; And could I have known That so much fright would fall upon the warren, On the riverside And on his spring, I might have found the perfect height And flung my spirit down. \n￼Famine I am the dog they ring bells for. Emptier than ever, hollower, And I am not hungry^or Hungry. I have lost hunger. My space contracts, I always escaped before. Down at the shore The sand is running out. Infinite hunger Yearns at the rim of the world. Famine gnaws my bones, Hunger is the core Beneath the film of mist And the comfort of men; their raw god, The one they ring bells for. \n￼Letter (on a beach) Down to cold stone To whet my heart It is not long, The letter with the burning lines. Hearts are sore, mine sings A mournful tune I have to listen to. The beach is raw, White waves crashing down on sin, Sky washed and the water in, Coke can in the undertow, A gull runs shakily at the edge. W ave after wave And the foam climbing up the dark Underbelly. The dark could punish But it comes too late - gull takes bright. A tightness climbs my throat My wings are trembling, White envelope, The end, the wrapper, the crumbs, the dregs. The weekend falls back like a medium weight. The letter walls me out, I feel Nothing And nothing is better.
