It is indeed the \u2018territorial\u2019 Kavanagh who most appeals North of the border. \u2018That original townland\u2019 (to transfer a phrase from Heaney\u2019s \u2018The Harvest Bow\u2019) strikes home where the language, metaphors and mentality of territory go so deep as to render poetry a form of multi-dimensional map-making. This reproduces, in A.T.Q. Stewart\u2019s words, the \u2018unavoidable fact of coexistence [which] dictates the most important aspect of the enduring conflict, which is that it must always be conducted in terms of topography\u2019.27 Heaney\u2019s significantly named essays (\u2018From Monaghan to the Grand Canal\u2019 and \u2018The Sense of Place\u2019) relish Kavanagh\u2019s poetry for being \u2018earthed in the actual\u2019 and weighted rather than weight  less, for possessing a keen \u2018appetite for the living realities of Patrick Maguire\u2019s world\u2019. He finely terms Kavanagh \u2018a parish priest\u2019.28 Kavanagh\u2019s doctrine that the \u2018parochial mentality...is never in any doubt about the social and artistic validity of his parish\u2019,29however compensatory, is often cited by Northern poets who follow him in translating local specificities on to symbolic planes. Whatever else may be in doubt, the stanza from \u2018The More a Man Has\u2019 intimately knows where it is. Even if Muldoon\u2019s parodic \u2018Moy\u2019 incorporates a bleak critique of parishes and priests, it upholds the spaciousness of specificity: \u2018I\u2019m very interested in the way in which a small place, a parish, can come to stand for the world.\u201930Yet both Heaney and Muldoon pull Kavanagh further North. Heaney reads into Kavanagh\u2019s poetry some of his own \u2018weightedness\u2019 (\u2018weight\u2019, laden with aesthetic and cultural value, is a term he borrows from Ted Hughes), obsession with \u2018growing down and in\u2019, and political interest in \u2018raising the inhibited energies of a subculture to the power of a cultural resource\u2019.51Kavanagh perceived his culture as self-inhibited, not externally oppressed, and his imaginative trajectory as to do with growing up and out. For Kavanagh, \u2018a peasant is all that mass of mankind which lives below a certain level of consciousness. They live in the dark cave of the unconscious and they scream when they see the light.\u201952 Heaney, removed from farmwork by education, revisits the rural un  conscious in a Romantic quest for archetypes, endowing it with pre  history as well as mystery. He finds \u2018opulent\u2019, rather than oppressive, \n￼Longley 196-226 4/5/94 12:08 pm Page 210 POETIC FORMS AND SOCIAL MALFORMATIONS \u2018the mill-race heavy with the Lammas floods\u2019 and perceives as lack or absence the fact that at \u2018the bottom of Kavanagh\u2019s imagination there is no pagan queen, no mystique of the national, the mythic or the tribal\u2019.33 This itself overlooks the social and personal history, and-historieaLeritique, written into The Great Hunger. Kavanagh\u2019s mystique or healing myth centres on \u2018light of imagination\u2019 - \u2018winking glitter\u2019 - not dark. The recalcitrant clay that symbolises the defor  mations of Patrick Maguire\u2019s world (where a \u2018monster hand lifted up children and put down apes\u2019) never takes on the amniotic aura of Heaney\u2019s bog - \u2018nesting ground,/outback of my mind\u2019. Kavanagh\u2019s \u2018In Memory of My Mother\u2019 repeatedly detaches her from \u2018the wet clay\u2019. There are evidently psychological as well as cultural or political differences here. Whereas, in Jungian terms, Heaney\u2019s \u2018mother ground\u2019 (rather unusually) reunites the male anima with maternal origins; Maguire\u2019s purgatorial entrapment, from which the narra  tive voice cannot or does not wholly extricate itself, resembles the hero\u2019s failure to \u2018deliver himself from the mother archetype (and from the infantile unconsciousness that the hero\u2019s bondage to her authority represents for the conscious personality)\u2019.34Poetry delivered Kavanagh into consciousness, but not into full personal articulation. His blockage in Dublin suggests that a rite of passage was never completed on a psychic as well as a cultural level. Hence those only partially healing poems that re-constitute Inniskeen as a pre-ado  lescent Eden. To recover innocence or his mother means accepting loss. In \u2018Innocence\u2019 \u2018I know nothing of women,/Nothing of cities\u2019 is a cry both of defiance and despair. Besides earthing their foundations, territorial cultures develop orienteering skills above ground, which poets\u2019 strategies and structures may imitate or interrogate. Parleying \u2018on the central stepping stone\u2019 (\u2018Terminus\u2019) is only one among Heaney\u2019s many self-images as picking a nice way through the long toils o f blood and feuding. (\u2018The Last Mummer\u2019) i Ca^'t at oJont T h e for weather-eyes// at cross-roads and lane-ends\u2019, emerges from a more pressing objective reality than do the spy-ridden landscapes of early Auden. On this internalised map divisions run within, as well as between, groups. Thus Muldoon\u2019s poetry features a comically elusive figure \u2018Golightly\u2019 as alias of the poet. However, he also becomes the tragically fugitive protagonist of \u2018The More a Man Has\u2019, pursued wary walker along networks o f boundaries, who has \u2018an eye / the Cor*iflU/uxl c r i s i s e \n￼Longley 196-226 4/5/94 12:08 pm Page POETIC FORMS AND SOCIAL MALFORMATIONS 211 by furies and \u2018Keeping down-wind of everything\u2019. Muldoon\u2019s techniques, too, of course involve artful dodging, disguises, shape- changes, riddles, undercover puns, cunningly subjunctive syntax. His poetry manoeuvres in a one-dimensional charmed space between irresistible forces - a Active reductio of the Ulster constraints: They came bearing down on me out of nowhere. A Buick and a Chevrolet. They were heading towards a grand slam. Salami on rye. I was the salami. So much for my faith in human nature. The age of chivalry how are you? But I side-stepped them, neatly as Salome... (Tmmram\u2019) A dance of veils, an ingenious rhyme, may be a lifesaver. Similarly, \u2018The Boundary Commission\u2019 challenges the binary terms of Heaney\u2019s \u2018Other Side\u2019 by reducing territorial maps to absurdity: You remember that village where the border ran Down the middle o f the street, With the butcher and baker in different states? Today he remarked how a shower of rain Had stopped so cleanly across Golightly\u2019s lane G It might have been a wall of glass That had toppled over. He stood there, for ages, T o wonder which side, if any, he should be on. The typical protagonist of Ciaran Carson\u2019s first-person poems, in The Irish for No (1987) and Belfast Confetti (1989), seems to have the fewest strategic options amid boundary-wars. Bemused by the \u2018 labyrinth\u2019 o f the city, he cannot read (or write) a; battleground where survival and syntax have become arbitrary: Suddenly as the riot squad moved in, it was raining exclamation marks, Nuts, bolts, nails, car-keys. A fount of broken type. And the explosion Itself - an asterisk on the map. T h is hyphenated line, a burst o f rapid fire... I was trying to complete a sentence in my head, but it kept stuttering... (\u2018Belfast Confetti\u2019) Free from the perplexities of \u2018Golightly\u2019s lane\u2019, \u2018man-killing parishes\u2019, the \u2018hyphenated line\u2019, Paul Durcan and Brendan Kennelly recreate the visionary rather than \u2018earthed\u2019 dimension of Kavanagh\u2019s poetry. The priest means more than the parish, spirit than technique; although here a contrast with Heaney\u2019s version of \u2018vision\u2019 is relevant. Heaney\u2019s more recent work, in The Haw Lantern (1987) and Seeing Things (1991), has links with the changed emphasis of his later essay on Kavanagh, \u2018The Placeless Heaven\u2019: sh<-f-b 1/1.3 ^ \n￼Longley 196-226 4/5/94 12:09 pm Page 212 POETIC FORMS AND SOCIAL MALFORMATIONS Where Kavanagh had once painted Monaghan like a Millet, with a thick and faithful pigment in which men rose from the puddled ground, all wattled in potato-mould, he now paints like a Chagall, afloat above his native dom ain, airborne in the m idst o f his own dream place rather than earthbound in a literal field.\u201d Yet this may be too clearcut an opposition, or too determined by Heaney\u2019s own artistic agenda. Now he exaggerates Kavanagh\u2019s airiness, as formerly his weightiness. Kavanagh\u2019s transcendental assertions are most poetically persuasive when hard-won from con  tingency. He \u2018recovers\u2019 Inniskeen not at will, but in the context of Dublin pressures. Experience - and the incapacity for experience - shadows the \u2018whitethorn hedges\u2019 of \u2018Innocence\u2019: \u2018They laughed at one I loved...\u2019 When Heaney discusses \u2018Innocence\u2019 in terms of \u2018luminous spaces within [Kavanagh\u2019s] mind\u2019, \u2018sites where the mind projects its own force\u2019,\u2018the white light of meditation\u2019,56 he may miss the emotional point. Certainly, it is not the same point as Heaney\u2019s trope of the felled chestnut tree transfigured into \u2018a bright nowhere\u2019, which symbolises the perpetual presence of his own past or (in \u2018Clearances\u2019) of his dead mother. Perhaps Heaney comes closest to one of Kavanagh\u2019s later parochial blends in \u2018The Harvest Bow\u2019, a poem which revisits \u2018that original townland\u2019, and its parish priest, for therapy in time o f war: \u2018 The end o f art is peace/Gou\\A be the motto of this frail device\u2019. Nonetheless, all Heaney\u2019s re-writings or significant misreadings of Kavanagh depend on place - placeless- ness being merely a variant. Durcan, on the other hand, sees his relation to Kavanagh as a religious allegiance: I have not \u2018met\u2019 God, I have not \u2018read\u2019 David Gascoyne, Jam es Joyce, or Patrick Kavanagh: I believe in them. Of the song of him with the world in his care I am content to know the air. This exudes Kavanagh\u2019s own belief in the poet as spiritual legis  lator: a concept that blends Romantic theory with a Catholic absolute  ness. Northern poets, in their statements about poetry, more prag  matically emphasise the poem, the word, the artifact. (This is true of Heaney\u2019s remarks about Millet and Chagall.) Durcan edited Kavanagh\u2019s long-buried poem Lough Derg (1978), and his Foreword expounds the text as a book of revelation: much of his work - Lough Derg being a classic example - demands of the reader spiritual courage as well as highly sensitive powers of perception... Besides being a great poem Lough Derg is also a spiritual document: for not only was Kavanagh himself a mystical (in the strict sense of the work) man but he had a tremendous understanding of the fact...that ","docTitle":"","docDate":"1994-04-05"},"meta":{"contentType":"text/raw","emVer":"7.1.1103.5","langIdVer":"DefaultLangId","processingVer":"CalaisJob01","submissionDate":"2014-07-01 09:58:41.771","submitterCode":"57b17a53-6e34-87b0-20ff-a419896f49c9","signature":"digestalg-1|XV/QFPrQjB3hqnpuu9GN6QWsDYU=|Ygl0jsBYkWJjMm9ZZcFuRt0WHgFQKSzVmTAnWGTDPVsffSl7lXG+Kw==","language":"English"}},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/2b884d46-55f7-35b3-8e94-fef27978468e/lid/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http://d.opencalais.com/lid/DefaultLangId/English"},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/ebb0a6ac-92fc-359c-8502-dce14e312553":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"Position","name":"poet","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/Position","instances":[{"detection":"[ comically elusive figure \u2018Golightly\u2019 as alias of ]the poet[.
