The one, with the chest of a child, Dancing from her millefiori Grove, light as a spore On the wind, spilling Flowers on the polished floor; The other, loosening her shift Irrevocably so she slips from her frame, One breast exposed, slow, in her soft Mass of flesh, cupping The incidental rose. And what if they should? \u2014 There would be little to say With only the language of flowers: But differences, in the shrewd, mute way O f women, would be observed. The one, troubled by the other\u2019s lack Of scent, the absence of her shadow, The flowers of make-believe That blossom from her lap ^here no men go; The other, meeting gravity for the first time, Checked in her weightless dance, Senses power in the flesh\u2019s substance, Its smell - of more than flowers - And the coloured shadow it casts.
