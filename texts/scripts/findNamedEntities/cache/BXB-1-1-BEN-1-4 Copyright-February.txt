I have a race memory of this place; Its formal flora, face-distorting spoons, And the indigenous tribes, of bearers and borers. Sometimes I dance, held hot against black serge, And often I ask, Shouting above the music, About Croydon, or the Common Market, or the children. Before the dancing we had the speeches, And that was a peaceful time. An interval of pleasant stupefaction Infused with coffee and brandy. Further back still, there was the cream gateau And, penetrating deeper layers of the past, The lamb, the trout, the soup, And, with each, a subject briskly explored, 1 To right and to left, In the prehistoric, previous world I was still here, Empty and chattering over gin, And smiling winningly into unfamiliar faces. But, unlike some younger people, I can still remember the world outside, And I know that one day we will all go home And find rest, and the cat waiting to be fed. 4 With eye contact and ego projection. 1' »2> J P^tsSS, -f- f o u i o 1 / (jv'Cljb I\u2019;i:.; \n￼April Here comes Spring. Season (stirring dull blood) of spots And suicides. Better, those of us who are at risk To skip April, May, Miss the worst of the disorientation, The conviction that life Is coming up with some colossal romantic musical For which the casting director has, yet again, Overlooked you. The hard light, the sudden knife-like breeze, The grey pallor of those strips of skin So tentatively bared. The tender vulnerability of the pale buds in the hedge. Dig up the garden And stop your mind with your transistor. This dangerous change will soon pass. \n￼IMr Cardiac Department Discrete, disconsolate, The heart patients gather in the waiting-room. Drawn together, but facing apart Arid thinking about their ECGs. They\u2019d like to pretend They\u2019re in the buffet at King\u2019s Cross Waiting for the 6.15: But more serious matters are at stake: Life insurance; or life itself. The nurse is their mother here, Her smiles flow out Bright and inexhaustible as conjurors\u2019 bunting. * The cleaner is having a mysterious mid-morning clean. \u2018Don\u2019t move lovd^ she says, \u2018Don\u2019t move.

They are fat Beyond the merely Rubenesque. 4 One has a striped umbrella Over her head. She suffers with the sun. Another has the thermos, which she\u2019s handing on to Flo, For Flo gets parched; and all of them are kind. Indeed, if you were losfedf you had missed the path wvTh That led back round the hill They\u2019d help you; they would hem you in And wall you round with helpfulness. Such a stockade: No harm could penetrate. You\u2019d be safe there, Safe, and in clover. Corseted in folding chairs, Armoured in synthetics; Their considerable legs stretch forward in unison. In the East, they would be collectors\u2019 pieces. \n￼Commuter Coke tins glisten in the showery gutters, The turd-strewn grass is springing rank and green. Dull glass catches light it had forgotten And I am expected home on the six-fifteen. In the warmth, my briefcase is relaxing; The non-press collar manacles my neck. Steam is rising from my pinstripe suiting. I feel the message, but can I answer back? My hand on the telephone is winter white. It clams to the plastic. No one answers my call.

But somehow my problems made the analyst hungry. We took to cooking ourselves bijou meals And lying down to discuss them, Whiling away whole nights That man has really taught me a thing or two, And his light touch with a souffle Has quite made me forget my academic career. In psychogastric speculation. \n￼What land is that, stained out Across the wall ? I think I knew it when I was a boy. Twisting my neck on the pillow I can see the coast, And that inlet\u2014the grey shading into the shallows\u2014 Where the village was. My mother wore blue serge Down to her boots.

There was, perhaps\u2014 Can one recall\u2014 Some interpenetration of the flesh In the shafting half-light from the afternoon blinds. Movements and time were mindless; Half-entranced by the clock\u2019s tick And the clip of the blown vines On the trellis wall. ^' But was there a world outside? Or was it a room that was traced in the sand (Where the incoming tide lapped a regular pulse) By the hand of the dreamer, who seemed in his sleep To feel salt lips on his closed eyes In the dim room, with the clock\u2019s tick And the tap of the vines in the faint breeze From the warm sea As it sighed, outside. zo \n￼Father Christmas Last year\u2019s Father Christmas Caught pneumonia and died Through standing in the shopping precinct Shaking his tin in all weathers, Under the municipal Christmas tree. This year\u2019s Father Christmas is of wax, Sitting on a stool, apple cheeked And smiling without relief, His tin intimately lodged between his knees. ¥ 4 Yesterday someone fell under wheels Before his very eyes, Crying out, and bleeding in a Christmassy colour; And he smiled and smiled, Never turning his head at the ambulance bell Or envying the attentions of the crowd. \n￼February February, a poor month for the foot fetishist: Wellingtons, old clodhoppers, Socks that have almost breathed their last, And when the occasional foot is glimpsed, naked, By the determined voyeur, It is deathly pale and flabby, Contoured and moulded by the winter boot, And, though fascinating, hardly contemporary: More like something unearthed from a previous season. 4r But dream hotly, you fellow fetishists Of a spell in March, When the weather may break, and evoke The first disturbing sandals of the year. ~>A ","docTitle":"","docDate":"2014-07-01 09:46:12.105"},"meta":{"contentType":"text/raw","emVer":"7.1.1103.5","langIdVer":"DefaultLangId","processingVer":"CalaisJob01","submissionDate":"2014-07-01 09:46:08.517","submitterCode":"57b17a53-6e34-87b0-20ff-a419896f49c9","signature":"digestalg-1|XD1pLKm3PmNbFUmKk0cdDhjME+Y=|Y8Ly8yMg1KfF2qDw8PN4bq3ffw+B/PCdAHSBeUypPeph8snE5Po9Uw==","language":"English"}},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/1819352d-37a4-3154-baee-8da77fbb5859/lid/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http://d.opencalais.com/lid/DefaultLangId/English"},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/ebb0a6ac-92fc-359c-8502-dce14e312553":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"Position","name":"Poet","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/Position","instances":[{"detection":"[fimes Literary Supplement.^Tnifcune, and With ]a Poet[\u2019s Eye (Tate Gallery, 1986; -\"T 'Heaven on]","prefix":"fimes Literary Supplement.^Tnifcune, and With ","exact":"a Poet","suffix":"\u2019s Eye (Tate Gallery, 1986; -\"T 'Heaven on","offset":1769,"length":6}],"relevance":0.3},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/9b6d7ed2-4c40-333c-81d0-0a6fda48b2f2":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"Organization","name":"European Economic Community","organizationtype":"N/A","nationality":"N/A","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/Organization","instances":[{"detection":"[Shouting above the music, About Croydon, or the ]Common Market[, or the children.
