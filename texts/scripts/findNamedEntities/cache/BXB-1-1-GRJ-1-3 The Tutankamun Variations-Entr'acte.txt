A running story, like the war. But not the war. An English story. Like Jack the Ripper. Like the Titanic. Like Scott of the Antarctic. We miss the hot lead We used to catch. We miss those fat statistics That used to cover our front pages. We can do nothing with this Latest dance, that latest creation. We are ready to jump into an aeroplane And leave for any part of the globe. (What is that Messenger carrying So swiftly from Dover?) We need a story. (Who is that recluse reminiscing Amid the cigar smoke?) We need a story. (And what is being unsealed? And why that smile? And whose are the words on that telegram We are looking for a story For the aristocracy at breakfast, For the middle classes on the train, For the working-man on the street corner \n￼(And why has the Editor of the Times Gone to Newbury Races?) Something to do with money. One story that is a total Eclipse of the sun and will last Until the next war. Something to do with death. (And why has the Earl of Carnarvon Cancelled all his engagements?) Something to do with mystery.________ We are looking for a story That will set the peace ablaze. A story that is not a question. Not Irish. And not emancipated women. But which can be embroidered And photographed and sold. (Where is that young man hurrying With his notebook?) And not the civil war in China. (What is that noise in the telegraph wires?) And not the riots in Egypt. 3' IZ 3>Of7fvfr \n￼^The landscape overhead will not be changed By flash-flood: it is a civilisation Bunkered securely in its desolation. More admirable, too, than this gold arranged About my sarcophagus - hanging its strange Treasures freely on view, a virgin cache Unnoticed by the lords whose liberation From dirty politics is a trench In the Kings' Valley. I warned them to keep Their distance from this entrance and its seal. Anubis is no god, but a dog asleep, So let him lie. Small punctures may heal Once you've unmuzzled him; but not (that steep Descent over) your mad desire to steal.^ ^ 13 \n￼THEODORE DAVIS 5 LAST SEASON I have dug for treasure the way I smoke without stopping, and obsessively. If I could have made my fortune like one Mr Standwood of Maine, & who imported mummies by the ton to turn into brown wrapping paper, then I would have saved myself twelve years of sweat. Or if I had been alive £ the century before him, I should have ground up the flesh and sold it A: to the poor at an immense profit. But no one today is after mummy-powder. If I surrender this choice concession, then that pariah dog Carnarvon will be down A scratching where I've been, although he knows I have already published Touatankhamanou. * It's only this old seductress on my desk, this strange alluring figurine - \n￼and when I hear her boyish voice, ^the best is yet...** I should know it's time to quit: she has promised me into too many dark and secret hollows, whispering \u2018'intact''... 4^ I shall return to Florida, and make sure I die before she can call back: CSee? I promised!1* t \n￼1972 I am waiting, like all the others, waiting To open the sacred seal and discover My future; and as I wait, this exhibition Snakes me through steel barriers to my golden Eighteenth year where I catch, amid the darknes That enfolds a teenage Pharaoh's history, Glimmerings of a more personal history, As if it had lain beneath the sand waiting For me to come and dig into its darkness In search of the famous Mask but discover Only in each glass case my own face, golden. It is my coming-of-age exhibition. All aspects of me are in this exhibition: The child's chair and board-game are a history Of my early youth; my teens were that golden Dagger. This trumpet, this cow-bed are waiting For me to experiment, to discover In their cross-meshed passages of darkness, &yv> In sexual unity and divine darkness, The Goddess Hathor's milk-white exhibition Of her transfiguring powers: discover Between her lyriform horns all history. The Necklace of the Rising Sun is waiting To embrace us, its clasp is cool and golden... \n￼Each morning my hopes shoot greener, but golden Futures only bloom after months in darkness, During nights of counting the weeks of waiting, And now at this jubilee exhibition I am persuaded that time and history Are relative. Come, UCCA! and discover To me the sacred light, let us discover The place where we are to spend our golden Prime and inscribe our names on history, As one young man did, emerging from darkness At eighteen to become this exhibition - The very thing for which we are all waiting. / \n￼cg= THE CEDARS |TIGHCLERE I see him in the distance. The stories he tells them waft across to me as I trim the lawns beneath his cedars. 41 He loves cedars: his father asked my father to put them in. The Egyptians made all their tables and chairs out of cedar, -4 he told me once, were buried surrounded by it. Now he's alone on that fancy verandah, reading, or glancing up towards 4 these living crowns - always some fat volume open beside him. That's (he'd say) since forty days stuck out in the tropical seas 4* with so little to do, between fighting off pirates and avoiding hurricanes, that he fell prey to the bookworm. But we know. In the old days he would never have stopped still long enough to have turned a leaf. If it wasn't the sea, it was the turf; if it wasn't the latest horseless carriage, it was some infernal air machine. Faster, always faster, until -4 Trotman comes running to pluck him out from that blazing wreck in the Black Forest - head smashed, heart stopped. 4- And all he wanted to know was had he killed anybody! Next thing, he is making Highclere a home for war-wounded, -4- young lads cowering behind this shadow-line: muttering, wide-eyed ghost battalions. M'lord was never one to let the grass grow. \n￼Today he showed us another of his latest photographs - one of a mummified cat, which wasn\u2019t at all well received by his dog - 4= nor by her Ladyship, for that matter. But then, we all have doubts about this digging up of times long gone. The papers make jokes 44 about the thousands he has wasted (with 36,000 acres here to keep) and to my own thinking, when there's talk of a curse 44 you think twice. He's already had a good nine lives - chased by a wild elephant in South Africa (more of an achievement 44 to have escaped than shot it, he said!), then only last week rushed to the hospital with three quarters of an hour to live. When he dies, it will be in a way nobody could have foreseen. £I don't think I've lost my nerve,*' he whispered, straight 4\" , after that accident. And he won't let anyone wrap him up in bandages. ^1 want to be buried,* he laughs, fout in the open, -4 high up on Beacon Hill, then - if you like \u2014 ^ to us, he calls us his garden angels! - ^plant one of de Havilland's DH9s 44 above me like a Pyramid; and make sure the grave is dug by a professional archaeologist!\u2019' Tomorrow he's off out to the East again. The last season, he has announced. cIf the Pharaohs don't bite, the mosquitoes certainly will.*' 13,+ ----------- 5b \\7 \n￼CARTER BEGINS |\u2014-y^----\u2014 ---------1'' 2-^lb There is a language of rock that is not like the language of diplomacy or newspapers or love. One must know how to read it, where to begin. None of us has heard it spoken, though some taste the air into which its last words evaporated, a few have grovelled to wrench gold fillings from its mouth. There is a grammar of rock, but its secrets are guarded by aloof priestesses, their fingers to their lips as they scald meaning from the bones. I will begin with a triangle I know to mean hope. Aboard the Champollion, steaming towards the Pharos, unknown, unrecognised, 49 pH I imagine steps that lead into chambers full of the poetry of this rock language. \n￼The Valley in which we search fruitlessly is peaceful: we dream of gardens or of a golden age, and our looking is contented. If we knew what sentences of hard labour await us the day we crack the dream, we would not know rrtvfr 7 this pleasure, sipping at perhaps and may, shifting ten thousand irritations at a stroke. But the demons of discovery are less considerate - they will block- book the hotels, and arrive each morning in dark glasses, -4ctpte rattling metal plates, begging their thousand words. Vv^V\\s-n \n￼Down to bedrock now - but all we have to show is thirteen jars containing the remains of sweet oils used to anoint the dead. Lady Carnarvon stoops and for an instant glows pre-Raphaelite again: Miss Almina Wombwell delivering the first flush of her youth into her lover's arms. Is this a final remembrance of ^that night devoted to oils, when thou art re  united with the earth^? Now she kneels to a lost fragrance, alabaster jars look pale disciples; and we - two wretched thieves mocked and left here to parch with a mystery king. \u2014 \\°\\ \n￼<z------ ENTR'ACTE ^ Some friendships fell apart when they met our English damp. Some were too delicate to have been carried out of the past. Perhaps others will be reclaimed and restored. Two sentinels remain standing: ______ ___________Stuart, you were as watchful and all- seeing with your one eye as Ra, ever-forgiving when we forgot and threw the old washing-up sock for you to catch; breaking into your native Welsh in the souk, or kick-starting a rustic Arabic which you had patched up until it could drive a class of sixty to drill out, ^11m-fine-thanks!^ to your every ftHow are you?3 And how you hated that head  mistress of ours (whose name meant 'tin can', and whose face resembled one) for wagging a finger at you when you tried to \"borrow\" one of her clutch of Louis Quatorze to stock our chairless staff-room. \n￼# i x y ^ 20 You could bellow your own Son-et-Lumiere when you wanted to get things done your way; or simply sat with your shoe- soles turned insultingly on your victim. fox!** as our idiom-proud Inspector of English chuckled. Yes - and a superb actor to that last encore when you soliloquised draconian indignation before a baffled policeman. Scene: the Pyramids. To Be Or Not To Be arrested on your last day in Egypt. Always making new friends and taking us on sightseeing marathons through backstreet dust-bowls and open sewers to try a glass of sugared tea and bassboussa - to meet Abdul Kareem, black and glistening on the desert's rim in a mud-brick storage-heater, whose latrine ran cockroaches, and whose library lacked only Volume Two of Lives of the Poets to meet Mr Sami and his Violet, who fish-fed us and let us bloat on their privileged panorama of the Nile and Sadat being bulleted past, as they put in their requests for Macleans tooth  paste, Marks & Spencer shirts... then merrily bolted the door \n￼to show us the strength of their hospitality - Stuart, you tolerated it all, even when Alan popped up, dear utterly-different-from-you old Alan, whose cracked earthenware humour could keep even his own temper cool. Who else would try to tell the joke about a whisky and a white horse called Eric to a room full of Moslem Brothers? Or endlessly repeat the story of how he slid down into that camel's ball-cracking jaws such that I can still smell its eunuch-making snorts today? Alan, we miss you falling off your bike, and holding forth on hieroglyphs and syntax and black kites, or blundering into arguments with jumped-up officialdom and market-sharks and little horrors and big#wigs and Jane. Even Jane (like the frogs who used to rev-rev as you sang) misses your crooning choruses - 'Beware of Long Lankin...' Beware all those unmarried girl students gazing at you from inside their Dalek costumes. ^Will you allow me to come in?^ you made them repeat if they were late. Task-master! And Asmi, Z \n￼our old laundry man, he misses your Nile-smooth conversations up on that scorching roof above the domino slaps, sheesha fumes and warbling wailing casse drone of the cafe.
