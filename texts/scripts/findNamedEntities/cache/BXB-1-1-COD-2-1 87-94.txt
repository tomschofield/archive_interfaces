She is indifferent to love e.------ The Hymn to Aphrodite These things are told by the Muse of golden Aphrodite, the Cyprian, who eXcites desire even among The gods, and men who are under death's dominion Are under hers too as are the winged birds And all creatures the land rears and the sea. Garlanded Cytherea troubles them all. * Against three of her own. kind it is true she is powerless: °f And delights in discord and warfare, the works of Ares; But also in the manufacturing of fine things. She first taught earth's craftsmen the making f__ Of war-rchariots) in intricate bronze And young girls the management of the house-*-all Beautiful works of their hands come from her teaching. Nor can the huntress Artemis, armed with golden Arrows, ever be subjugated by Aphrodite, The lover of laughter. For she loves archery, The hounding to death of animals on mountains, The clamour of pursuit in bark forests; but also The lyre, dance and the rule of civil law. Finally the virgin Hestia cares nothing for The works of Aphrodite. Strangely born / The first and youngest child of cunning Ghrono-s K^\\os She steadfastly refused Apollo and Poseidon Who wanted her in marriage. On the head of Zeus She swore to live her immortal life a virgin'. She had great honour from Zeus instead of marriage. She has her place in the middle of the house, The best portions are hers. In all the temples She is reverenced. None of the immortals Is more highly thought of by mortal men. These Aphrodite cannot sway. Otherwise not one Among the blessed gods nor any man Has ever eluded her. She distracts the mind (/CifOOO^ \n￼£.ve.n o\"f Zeus ~to v/chor^o \"t_hz, \"tKondtc is A plaything and whose majesty is greatest.

She loved him immediately. Desire took nold of smiling Aphrodite as soon as she saw the man. She went to Cyprus, To Paphos where her precinct and altar are, Into her fragrant house. The shining doors Being closed, she was bathed by the Charities And anointed with an oil she had that the gods ? Perfume themselves with. She clothed her body In beautiful clothes and put on gold for ornament And laughing she left fragrant Cyprus And flew to Troy through the high clouds Quickly making her way. So she came To Ida of the innumerable streams And mother of wild beasts and went at once To the sheiling across the mountain. After her, Pawning upon her, came grey v/olves and fierce lions, Bears and the fast deer-hunting leopards. It pleased her to see them and she made Them lust, so that they coupled in the shadowy combes # But she herself came to the hill farm A\\kCrt\u2014 * \n￼sc \u2014 esHoo} ^ And found him alone there, his companions being out, l>-^\u20ac~sire^rT>)'Anchises whose beauty was from the gods. His companions were following the herds over the pastures And he was quite alone in the house Wandering here and there and strumming on a lyre. \u20224 Aphrodite, daughter of Zeus, she stood Before him, like a virgin girl in appearance, So that when he saw her he should not be afraid. But still he was amazed, for she v/as tall and imposing. He stared at her shining clothes. She wore A peplos brighter than the brightness of fire, Golden, beautifully worked, that Like moonlight over her soft breasts, and this Astounded him, and the twisted brooches, ear-rings Like calyxes and, lovelier than anything he rad ever seen, Necklaces on her white throat. Then love Took Anchises hold. He said: \u2019Vfelcone, Lady, to my house, whichever one you are Of the immortals, whether Artemis or ^eto or Golden Aphrodite or Themis or oright-eyed Athene, or perhaps you are one of the Graces Who are comoanions to the gods and are called immortal, Or one of the Nymphs who inhabit the pleasant woods Or one whose places are this lovely mountain And where the rivers start and these grassy meadows.

You Be kindly disposed and grant me eminence Among the Trojans and strong sons for the And let me live long in the daylight Prosperous among my people as I age.' , in all future Aphrodite, the child of Zeus, replied: \u2019Anchises, second to none in fame among mortal men, I am not a goddess, why did you think me one? A mortal mother bore me to die as you will. My father is Otreus, you will have heard of him, He rules Phrygia with its many fortresses.

Now Hermes, of Argus, Bearer of The Golden Wand, has snatched me from the dance Of Artemis the Huntress with the golden arrows Where we were playing together, nymphs And marriageable girls and a crowd surrounding us. Then Hermes snatched me from among them And carried me over many tilled fields And over much land owned by no-one and untilled Where savage beasts stalk in the shadowy combes Until I thought I should never again set foot On the good earth. And he said I should be The wife of Anchises and bear you beautiful children, And having said so he, Hermes, withdrew Among the deathless gods and I have come To you, bound by necessity. 5y Zeus I beg you now and by your noble parents- Por noble they must be to have &\u2022 son like you- Take me, a virgin and ignorant of love, And show me to your father and egudent.mother (Anci to your brothers, that they may judge what sort Of wife I shall make you, and send quickly To the Phrygians, whose horses go like the wind, To tell my father and my grieving mother, .^nd they will send you quantities of gold t.

And when They v/ere together on the bed he first Removed the jewellery from her body^ Unfastened her dress at the shoulders, undid The twisted brooches, the ear-rings, the necklaces, UUr Loosed her girdl-c and so one by one Took off her shining clothes and laid them Down on a silver-studded chair. Thus ignorant Of what he did, by tne will of the gods and fated^ he lay, a mortal man, with a deathless goddess. \u2022+ But at the hour when the herdsmen drive the cattle And sheen home into the fold from the flowery pastures Aphrodite caused Anchises to sleep sweetly But she dressed in her fine clothes again And fully clothed stood by the oed tall As the roof now and her dace radiant with the beauty Only the immortals have, and among them only Cytherea. Then she woke him sayim Dardanus' son I wonder what you are dreaming, look now Whether I am as you first saw me.' He heard her and woke at once, out when He saw the throat and lovely eyes of Aphrodite Then he was afraid and avrted hiseves and hid His face-^that she found beautcful-^Tn his c oak Bntreatng her so: 'When I first saw you, goddess, I knew you for what you are, though you denied it. But now by^Zeus beg you Do not leave me like one of the dead among The living. Have mercy.

You will be loved. You will have a son who will be dear to you and me He will be king among the Trojans, and children Upon children will continue your family for ever. He will be called Aeneas, on account of the grief It gives me to have slept with a mortal man Though among such your family has always Approached nearest the immortal gods in looks. cbifui-c. -e> Did not Zeus, (iolden-haired G-anymedes for his beauty To be among the immortals and pour them Their drink, drawing the red nectar Prom a golden bov/1? They held him in hon ,ur And wonder. Tros however was inconsolable Not knov/ing where the whirlwind from heaven Had carried his dear son whom day in, day out, He mourned. Then Zeus took pity, and raid him Compensation for the boy in the form of high- Steoping horses-^such as carry the immortals. And with this gift Hermes, obeying Zeus, Explained all and said the boy would neither Die nor age but be like the gods. At this Tros left off v/eeping and turned to rejoicing And rode his stormy horses with a glad heart. And Eos too, throned in gold, took up Another of your race, Tithonus, also In appearance like the deathless gods and asked Kfv^os The cloudy son of Chronos that he should Live for ever. Zeus assented. She had her wish, Poor fool, who never thought to get him besides Eternal life eternal youth and total Remission of old age. Thus in the flower Of his life he lived like one of the blessed With the young and golden Eos by Ocean's Streams at the world's end^until grey showed In his hair and beard, marring their beauty. Then Eos the Queen never came to his bed But still kept him in her house and saw M next line his wisdom, carry off KronoS \n￼No#betane ftw: This great and holy mountain, for in nature They are between mortals and gods. They live long And eat heavenly food and dance the lovely Dance with the gods and goddesses and with them Sileni and Hermes himself, the sharp-eyed KJCO~r of Argus, go into the dark places Of pleasant caves to lie down together in love. And at their birth pines or high oaks spring up With them on the nurturing earth, beautiful, tall And flourishing trees on the high mountains. They Are called holy places of the gods and no man Would ever loo them with an axe. But when The nym\"hs are fated to die and death is close To him with food and ambrosia and fine clothes until Foul old age overwhelmed him and he Was heloless to raise or move his limbs. Then she thought best to lay him in a room And to close the bright doors on him and there He babbles on for ever and cannot lift A finger, who was formerly lithe and strong.
