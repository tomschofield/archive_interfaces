The lolling willows, the silver shadows, all formed a part of it. I look up. The water boatmen scurry round the lilies. There is the meniscus, echoing the curve of the eyeball; also the curve to the horizon. Under my back, the river gravel, my bed and board and shelf life; and here am I, victim of my average weekly yearnings, so peaceful now as all the curves darken, one by one, in harmony. 68 \n￼CENTRAL RESERVATIONS \n￼DAILY ROUND \n￼Clay Pipes Here is the box with the pieces of clay pipe, stems like twigs, bowls swagged and ribbed, all cracked and chipped; but neatly docketed in your schoolboy hand. They were difficult to spot on the river bank amongst the pebbles. We spent hours bent over like ancients, quartering the ground (you in your first adolescence, me in my second). The Thames mud smelled of beer from the brewery; fishermen stood peacefully in their waders, while we scrunched and scraped and pounced with nervous absorption. When two pieces jigsawed together you gave your special, satisfied frown. Addictions W e\u2019re all hooked on something: gold or pinchbeck; solitude; a particular pain, the soft option or something harder. Kick one habit and, as you stand quietly at the window, another will dust down that empty chair and settle in. 72 \n￼Bed In this store window, a vast bed, radiant white in satin, lace and crystals, embowered, flounced and veiled: a Swan Lake \u2014 an iced cake of a bed; unsullied, intacta. It knows nothing of body fluids, amorous heats, night sweats, births-, couplings, dyings - such leaky businesses. By this bed, a lover would kneel, slender as a freesia, his samite cuff trailing the floor. Could you relish so immaculate a conception? Central Reservations I\u2019ve just been taught another damn lesson. Is there no end to them? It\u2019s still all life tests, crossroad decisions, multiple choices. Even last words may be subject to assessment: but do we have faith in the examiner? As I ponder this, a voice issues from clouds looming above the window: Trust me, it booms, we know what I am doing. 73 \n￼August in the Offices The small divorces of the summer offices relieve the year, let in the air. Absentees sun themselves by succulent hedgerows or sit in rain-soaked reveries on river banks - but their desks gather accretions; the names on their doors have a distant, commemorative look. Territories suffer encroachment, feuds and flirtations lose their fine balance; but in September - the canvas shoes flung to the back of the cupboard - flocks of fresh memos gather for the winter. The Claimant There\u2019s no reasoning with gloom: it breaks out from below the pavement into your head, into the corners of the room. Supposing you trace its lineage. What\u2019s the point? Name it; it merely answers You 're the one I want. 74 \n￼One\u2019s Correspondence I wrote to you to say that I\u2019d be there but lost the letter giving your address and now I cannot find it anywhere. Although I\u2019ve searched until I\u2019m in despair, what\u2019s worrying me most is, I confess, I wrote to you to say that I\u2019d be there. It came first thing on Tuesday (to be fair the breakfast table was in quite a mess) and now I cannot find it anywhere. I think you said you lived in Berkeley Square or did you say you\u2019d moved to Inverness? I wrote to you to say that I\u2019d be there. Where parties are concerned, you have a flair. The letter said: \u2018Please come in fancy dress,\u2019 and now I cannot find it anywhere. I\u2019m sure I wrote a note but couldn\u2019t swear to posting it: this is an S.O.S. - I wrote to you to say that I\u2019d be there and now I cannot find it anywhere. \n￼Compassion Waiting in the supermarket queue with my mange-tout and steak, I gazed abstractedly at the shoes of the woman in front - plastic and misshapen, sticking plaster where one rubbed at the instep. In her basket (her hands grey and knucklv) some small bony meat. She look^ so illimitably patient and hopeless that the easy tears blurred my eyes at the cash desk. But then I went home again, and I was so busy with my dinner party, you see. Confession One day, she told a stranger on a train everything. After twenty years she didn\u2019t find it easy to begin, but then, encouraged by his faint, grey nods, she fitted words together: explanations, revelations, vindications - the relief was enormous. She touched her face with cambric, feeling shriven. At the next station he rose, creakingly, \u2018So very' nice to chat with you, but I fear the conversation was a shade one-sided. This wretched deafness...\u2019 \n￼Problem One After a wedding, ten people stay the night in a house which has one W.C. At 9 a.m. the hostess administers 150 ml. tea to each person, and all sip at the rate of 50 ml. per minute. 90% of the guests then fall to planning a furtive sortie to the W.C. - not wishing to attempt fur-tongued, half naked pleasantries en route. The protagonists crouch anxiously behind their door-jambs, like characters in an early French cine-melodrama, struggling to interpret the creak of the floorboards, the click of a door-catch. Suddenly, a youth downstairs staggers from a sofa, pulls on jeans, plods up the stairs to the W.C. and locks himself in. He takes from his pocket a copy of Camus\u2019 The Plague, and settles down for a good read. \n￼Ladies at Lunch Do you remember his hand was shaking like this? Mine too, Elena, but you were always p f brave. \u2018You first Maria,\u2019 he said to me, and I held the needle over the flame. I don\u2019t think we tried to sterilise the cork. What innocents we were. How deliciously he shocked us: \u2018Of course this is only a metaphor for sexual penetration.\u2019 He kept stroking the cat absent-mindedly and having to wash his hands all over again. I thought we\u2019d be there all night. \u2018Let\u2019s get on with it,\u2019 I said, \u2018or my parents will be back.\u2019 I lay back in the chair and clamped my eyes shut. W hen 1 bled all over two linen napkins he went very white. He was much keener on sex than on ear piercing but he hoped that one thing would lead to the other. Which in time it did, in that bed-sit of his - so bohemian, all lino and frayed edges. We were both foolish, Elena, but at least I didn\u2019t let him marry me. 78 \n￼Heaven on Earth The loveliest times in all my life mymothertoldme- neartheendofit- mere when I used to go to the Caledonian Market on Tuesday mornings. I remembered her coming home on those Tuesdays, ruffled, animated, as from an assignation or triumph. Once she brought back a clockwork canary in a wire cage which sang on two notes and gyrated like a tiny feather duster. W hen it dropped off its perch she took it back to the stall quivering with delicious indignation and had it put miraculously right. In those days, she sighed, anything could be made better. Monochrome I want so much to find this empty room; the quiet light striking the bed into eminence against the shadowed walls. No view. No one calls. It is a retreat. Yet I would not pray there but lie between cool sheets watching the reflection of flowers, pale in their white jar. \n￼Diversions In old age, confined to bed, my mother developed a keen obsession. Lorryjack-knifedontheM4, she would cry as you skirted the commode to greet her: They '11have to leave at Exit 2 and go round here - she had a map on her bedside table: her thin finger quivered. Our small talk, our flowers and chocolates washed up against a tide of burst water mains, spillages, contraflows. We nodded solemnly. She\u2019d gained a nourishing rapport with all the road junctions in the country. Areyou sorryyou never travelled? I asked her. She shook her head at my stupidity. Every day, every night, she travelled. 80 \n￼Trouble Ahead In the taxi, in a sweating, static jam, you check your watch again. Your train! You\u2019re bound to miss it. And what about the stranger who is meeting you? Troubled scenarios blossom and race through your head. Someone leans on his horn, and the hooting spreads, like an animal cry through a herd. A bearded man strides back angrily from some crisis point ahead. Christ, can\u2019tyou wait afew minutes. Someone's dead. all fall silent but it\u2019s an exasperated silence. Death buggers up the traffic no end. People should die in bed. Choice You\u2019re the one I boned up mah jongg for You\u2019re the one I bought the chaise longue for You\u2019re the one I yearn to go wrong for. You\u2019re the one I\u2019ll garden my plot with You\u2019re the one I\u2019ll throwifin my lot with You\u2019re the one I\u2019ll find my G spot with. You\u2019re the one I\u2019ve had my teeth capped for You\u2019re the one my scruples were scrapped for You\u2019re the one I get all unwrapped for: You\u2019re the one. \n￼Don\u2019t Look Now Today, I have been seeing stairparts. It is best not to look directly at the heavy duty fixers, the two-gang pattresses (japanned and countersunk) or the sinisterly named door knob set with escutcheons. The togglers, with their rising butts and easy-on hinges, were hanging around as usual, waiting for straight couplings and high performance cavity screws; but the white-faced hardboard lay motionless and epoxy: it was sashlocked to the roundheads. Entrails I am cum ina'il that digestion is the great secret o f life - REV. SYDNEY SMITH Twenty-two feet of wonders Twenty-two feet of woes: Why we\u2019re obliged to have so many yards of them Nobody really knows. Sometimes they lie retentive, Sometimes they\u2019re wild and free, Sometimes they writhe and get madly expulsive The moment you\u2019re out to tea. 82 \n￼Entrails don\u2019t care for travel, Entrails don\u2019t care for stress: Entrails are better kept folded inside you For outside, they make a mess. Entrails put hara-kiri High on their list of hates: Also they loathe being spread on the carpet While someone haruspicates. Twenty-two feet of wonders Twenty-two feet of woes: Why we\u2019re obligj/ied to have so many yards of them Nobody really knows. Moscow Spring In the Kuskova gardens workmen lift the wooden boxes from the delicate statues. Tender bushes are unwrapped from their overcoats; twigs unbend in the melting light. The men warm to their work; hang their fur hats in a row on the fence. r 83 \n￼Games A rat with his head in a tin enjoys low tide. The river has exposed its flanks of mud and shingle: tusks of wood at the water\u2019s edge speak of mammoths or great amphibians but here on the path we pick our way through artefacts - expanded polystyrene chunky as peppermint toffee; string elaborately knotted; an old bald broom. Joggers thud past miming all degrees of anguish; but the gulls have landed in a drift on the water and are rocking in a trance up and down, up and down, on the wash from the pleasure steamer. 84 \n￼Faidagery Three men in camel overcoats - coarse, moon-faced, slicked-back hair - are sitting in the front row of an audience. They mutter to each other disapprovingly then rise, button their coats and ostentatiously leave, saying: \u2018I can\u2019t stand to see women committing Faidagery.\u2019 It\u2019s not in the dictionary: I look for it when I wake up. But it might be in some arcane tome or medical compendium. One could be committing Faidagery in all innocence. there is always something you do which annoys somebody. m \n￼Jessie\u2019s Bakery This shop, something o f a cult with local inhabitants for its delicious hot bread, was closed by the health authorities on thegrounds that theflour wasfull ofmoths. Blindfold, you could find it by the reek of stale cats. Big Jessie queens it here, her grey hair dollied up in yellow curls, six days a week. It takes her years to talk your loaf into a bag. The weather never tires of hearing about itself. Flour stirs and setdes; hours lag. In fact, time stops. Flies, as if in amber, stiffen in syrup tarts. Sultanas scab the shelves; the customers half remember the world, in its complexity and pain; and, like the lotus eaters, grow averse to facing it again. 86 \n￼Frank\u2019s Journal, December 1878 That morning, it was wonderfully cold. I put a bowl of water on the sill and in an hour it froze. So far, so good. The dog-cart picked me up at half past eight, then we collected Willie, Jack and Fred and up we went to Earith. By the time we started off for Welney, it was ten. My first long run on skates. They went ahead while I got in my stride with less despatch. My face ached from the wind: I had to rest by Bedford\u2019s, but I soon warmed to my work and got to Welch\u2019s Dam by halfpast twelve: the last six miles took only half an hour. The Welney skaters - fastest in the world - were marvellous to watch, and there were crowds to cheer them on. The low rays of the sun struck sparks of fiery light from skates and ice. At the Blue Boar we ate a pigeon pie and, taking biscuits and a flask of tea, we turned for home again, against the wind. We ran eight miles and rested by the Dam, then down the counter wash, across the bank and round by Hundred Foot, where just before a lad had drowned (but no) one that we knew). We passed the Dinsdale boys on Bun' Fen... and after that I slowed, and lagged behind. My legs were made of lead, my hands of ice; the sun had disappeared, the sky was dark; I prayed for strength to make myself keep on. I can\u2019t remember how 1reached my goal but Lansdowne James was standing on the bank. / 87 \n￼He pulled me from the ice, but I could move no more: my skates were frozen to my feet completely, so he took me on his back and carried me to shelter. Such a day! I offered prayers of thanks, and was so bold as to petition that the ice should hold. Wants Like yours, my wants are simple: security with the window ajar, the battle without the spilt guts; the family to throw off and rediscover: a magical bed-post and Life Everlasting, with my own teeth. \n￼THE STRONGER SEX f \n￼The Badminton Game That morning, I awoke and went down just as I was, in my green slippers, to look at the hydrangea mariesii - the only flower Clifton allows in the garden, for he must have his trees and shrubs. Out I crept, my slippers darkening in the dew, and hearing a movement beside me I turned and found Ruth. She was carrying the racquets; and so - smiling, not speaking - we ran between the great bushes to the net, and there we played (quietly, of course, so that Uncle Edward might not hear) until the breakfast gong recalled us. We ran up the backstairs en deshabille, and down the front ones, tardy though decorous, and kissed Uncle Edward; but I took care to embrace him as he likes best, to forestall reproof. Colour rose up behind his moustache and his face worked silently, but then he vanished as usual, behind The Times. She\u2019s Nothing But Trouble If she smiles, don\u2019t smile back. But of course you will, like an electrician taking chances with the wiring on a dull Tuesday afternoon. \n￼Albert Memorial Passing the Albert Memorial I remember our night of love, so-called, which started with a concert, and went on to the expensive hotel where we ate our supper too much, too rich, too noisy - the violinist, with his pander leer fingering and bowing over the stuffed avocado^ and I, like (but unlike) a Vestal Virgin wishing I were home at my sacred hearth. Courage! Courage! This is what is called Life. Put down the hermit\u2019s dish and tackle this hunk of meat - so vigorous it nearly leaps out of its sea of sauce. At last we are in the lift which elevates from Gluttony to Lust. The corridors stretch into infinity; such luxurious cells and here by the bed is a Gideon Bible. I open it, keen for guidance or diversion. Too late! You bend over me, tall as the Albert Memorial, or a tree, take the book and tidy it away, bored with the prologue and ready for the play.
