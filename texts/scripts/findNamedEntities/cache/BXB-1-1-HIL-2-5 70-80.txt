Walled birds, caged gardens, ox-blood leather buttons; a box of glass; a little one-armed mother. At the clinic queuing for injections, I can feel my occupant\u2019s soft limbs. There\u2019s the rabbit, there\u2019s the coat I knitted him. My breasts hang down and brush his lips like pears. The Sister says I don\u2019t look like a mother. Every day I hear his little prayers.

The babies smell of custard tarts. Deep breathing. I thought she was being angry so I cried. I must steal Mary\u2019s milk in the morning.- The after-coming head. Collapsing wives. The nurse came in to make my bed. She\u2019s knackered! Milk and blood will cloud the tepid bath. Fluffy babies make their mothers love them, fast asleep witjf prune-juice in their hair. The gorilla\u2019s house is dark. He wants his biscuits. He seems to hover on the verge of tears. We never feel cold. We are the mothers.

Wipe away his tears, his Pyrenees. / The children are asleep like little bags, the tulips are as sweet as marzipan, the cabbages are blue, the house-boat\u2019s red. The shaggy dog, once so devoted, \u2019s dead. The sound of heavy boots on the gravel. It would have been unbearable, I know. Smoking rollies on the day-room roof-top. \u201cThe first thing that she did was bite the nurse.\u2019 I must assume a normal public face. \u201cShe\u2019s been here since July.\u201d My eyelids close.

Dream of a dream and shadow of a shade. \u2018The writer\u2019s instinct is essentially heartless.\u2019 The wa-wa babies burst into floods of tears. Cherry nougat for the quiet children.

The boy is tired but happy in the moonlight. I saw some, falling faster, stuck with blood. I sleep curled up like shrimps in the darkness. I long for scenes where man has never trod. A less soft but a straighter whiteness rises. Mother Water, I\u2019m your baby now. A bedside light emits a stream of questions. Do not console me. I am not your friend. The yellow flip-flap of the alhatross. Now snow is filling up my little head. Like a butcher, deep in rubber buckets, tearing the hearts from cows\u2019 defrosting blood. Stuck in one position like a statue. You never lift a finger. Sunlit bone. Illuminated gloves. They killed my kitten. He was the shyest man I ever met. I wish I was a nice friendly person. I wonder why he\u2019s dirty. Let\u2019s go home. My father used to sleep in the stables. My mother knew at once when I made love. The man who is a bird smokes No. 6\u2019s. \u201cPut your empty packet in the bin.\u201d The nipples floating in the soup are carrots. My father\u2019s got a hornet on his chin. Far out, the lonely golfers start to cry. The anorexic suffocates in chocolate. My father wears a woolly cardigan with lozenges of fear inside the pocket. -e- 73 \n￼Hill Trembling 59-94 3/2/94 1:44 pm P,aje 74 e-- Seafarers gently drift across the ocean with dogs and chickens in their long canoes and colonise the islands east of China. He said it was his wedding. It\u2019s not true. I thought you\u2019d be so pleased - I shot the rabbits! Strips of striped pyjamas soaked in tea. The bulldog\u2019s blood drips on the red linoleum. Her fingernails jump about like fleas. I think they are thinking of Anna, washing cherries. He thought he was a goose. I\u2019m not surprised! The driver\u2019s going so fast they\u2019ll all get flattened. Beaded whisks of tails to swat fat flies. Lying on the kitchen floor to hug him. The doctor should be here any minute. The yellow parrot saying What a pity. Now his watch is ticking in my ear. It\u2019s true he was my lover. What a pity. The sun needs hearts of warm blood every day. We\u2019re old enough to sleep here in fine weather. Gertrude Bell has linen-covered thighs. Jealous of the hands that touched the breasts he was the first to marvel at. Don\u2019t worry. So easily you\u2019d think he\u2019s used to it. The light that fills the world sleeps in my bed. Waking up from dreams of frozen valleys and violet bluebells nodding by the pools. The face of God the doctor said I touched. And loneliness in pink kneels down to pray. The bedrooms house a family of camels. \u201cI hate to see a coffee getting cold.\u201d ________ The doctors say I read too much? They\u2019re staring.

The red-haired nurse spent all day in the day-room although she was off-duty. How do you know? Enormous jerseys and no knickers. Sand. Crystallised rose-petals. Ashes. Sheep. We watched the moorhens treading through the tree-tops their big green feet like camels\u2019. Itchy skin. Is she quiet and listless all the time, or is there something I should do, she wondered. Sitting looking utterly defeated, fingering the books she\u2019s not allowed. The bullfinches, the bats, the precious letters gobbled up for nothing. Go away. The same good-looking man who liked my cardigan. Or is that just my illness? Fairy cakes. The shaggy remains of a star give sweet instruction to sleepless lovers. \u201cWhat does he mean - he\u2019s \u2018going\u2019?\u201d I want to scream and scream and all I do is write I want to scream down in my book. Fathers coming closer like the tide. One word. Enclosed by hate. I feel like string. Apricots. Gold. Massed ascensions. Jam. They\u2019re coming now. They\u2019re going to flood my veins. The patients rise like early morning milk. ('1 The planets\u2019 movements alternate the tides. The waiting-room. It frightens me. The hole. DISEASES OF THE MIND. Pet monkeys. Silk. \n￼Hill Trembling 59-94 3/2/94 1:45 pm Rase 76 Wild bees know little joy. No visitors. I\u2019ve wanted to go home all my life. Moving deeper into purple woodland. Lop-eared rabbits, walnuts. Wearing boots. Ginger weasels cross the gated road. The little dog is limping. So am I. My mother says I\u2019m hopeless. Bits of lettuce. The doctor wrote it down: \u2018Her haunted mind.\u2019 He buttoned up the collar of my jacket and whispered in my ear \u2018She\u2019s dying now.\u2019 Boiled ham and tulips. It was evening.

My \u2018fortitude\u2019. That blissful state in which you feel forgotten. To get a little carpet in our bedroom, to go under the door, a little planed. Afternoons of fruit and acts of kindness. \u201cIs it true you\u2019re not allowed a mirror?\u201d Your mother called and said she left your washing crying on the disinfected floor. A lovely lady\u2019s holding out a rabbit. The lady smiles. The rabbit\u2019s name is Pam. M y skirt is like a lorry full of whiskers. It makes me feel sick to think of him. The nurse has got a rabbit. Yes, it\u2019s mine! I love its gleaming harmony! Apologies, I used to have a rabbit I called Pam. Voices I keep catching all the time. A mohair cardigan. A bowl of pears. I know she said don\u2019t listen to the voices.

I\u2019m blind. No time for sorrow\u2019s rippling fish. I\u2019m blood-soaked. The corner of the day-room shines like coal. Soon I will be better. At the moment I live in humble darkness like the mole. The gravel drive makes everybody stumble. The Virgin in her wooden dress is kind. Red roses tumble softly onto water. The day-room smells of toffee. I don\u2019t mind. \u201cLoving me is not enough.\u201d He laughed, feeling with his fingers up my skirt. He looked into my frightened, rubber eye-balls. He smelt of fennel, weasels, sandy dirt. Inmates waltz at dusk at party-time. Sitting by herself in fairyland. \u201cIt\u2019s far too late to start remembering now!\u201d The smell of fennel when they move. Thick tea. The sun is setting. It is time to start. \u201cEveryone admires our Christmas Tree!\u201d Sausages and chips and apple crumble. Everything she does is always wrong. The vicar gave us lovely cards and honey. The rich girl says her father won\u2019t be long. Moving hands and horses fill the sky. I do not need a coat. Leave me alone. The red-eyed doctors block the corridors with turquoise needles tipped with Methadone. The rocks like leopards soften in the rain. I see myself as Jesus\u2019 private nun, lost in the mists of time, when we were little - mushrooms; herons; woolly bears; my mum. -e- 77 \n￼Hill Trembling 59-94 3/2/94 1:46 pm 78 I had to cross the day-room on my hands, a silent rabbit foraging for fruit. I dread the human voice. The doctor said \u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do. We need your bed.\u201d The doctor\u2019s squirting juice into my eyes. Her name is Pam. \u201cI didn\u2019t say a thing.\u201d A bowl of cornflakes feels a shower of sugar; the erotic zone of Sister feels the same. I think I have swallowed a rabbit. It keeps wriggling. Reflections in still water. \u201cIs that right?\u201d Someone has painted my movements. I am banned. As thick as purple gravy when I strain. The porter eats his dinner with his hands. I saw him eating in my bed again. The daily wards of underwater fame. Swimming to the pills. Don\u2019t say my name. The hospital is underwater, Trixie. To widen brains, please nail all joints loosely. This little thing\u2019s been homeless for so long . Now say goodbye.

He\u2019s tall and thin with one hand in a bandage. I hear a faint pow-pow of disgrace. \u2018Departing for womanhood.\u2019 Crap. Green velvet cushions. The baker\u2019s sons are being introduced. The canteen of the airport smells of pepper. I follow him towards the setting sun. The avenue of cacti like an elephant shelter silent groups of staring men. We go upstairs. His buckle scrapes the brick-work. Lust and grief. Unusual cakes. He\u2019s kind. I\u2019m menstruating on a stranger\u2019s blankets. Sorrow like a silver spool unwinds. The sun is hot. My head is full of silence attracting hordes of angry bees like bells. A swallow-tail, an amber necklace, henna. I want to be so calm. \u2018Devotion frees.\u2019 People, horizontal, lit, ascending, now declare their everlasting love by open windows, where the tepid evening is tempting them to cast aside their clothes. -Unfriendly geese stand bythe fence like nurses,- and sheep run down the fluffy hill in rows. See me see me see me in the garden. I\u2019m made of ants. Whose voice is that? I t \u2019s hers. Feel between my legs two lips like lollies, or like a blood-hound on the verge of tears.
