Und ihr habt ein Gefiihl von Gesicht zu Gesicht, und das verleitet zur Schonung. Every morning new light comes warmly into the open house and you have a feeling that moves from face to face and that leads you astray to caring. RAINER MARIA RILKE translated by Robert Bly r \n￼O'Siadhail 9-46 5/7/95 4:24 pm Page Transit Urgencies of language: check-in, stand-by, take-off. Everything apace, businesslike. But I\u2019m happy here Gazing at all the meetings and farewells. I love To see those strangers\u2019 faces so quickened and bare. A lost arrival is wandering. A moment on edge, He pans a lounge for his countersign of welcome. A flash of greeting, sudden lightening of baggage, As though he journeyed out morder to journey home. I watch a parting couple in their embrace and freeing. The woman turns, aAeronica with her handkerchief Absorbing into herself a last stain of a countenance. She dissolves in crowds. An aura of her leaving glance Travels through the yearning air. Tell me we live For those faces wiped into the folds of our being. & \n￼0'Siadhail 9-46 5/7/95 4:24 pm Page Folding Our summer hide-out was the crotch of an old sumac, A bole V-ing upwards into its light and pliancy, Our feet in the fork, its boughs against our back; A huddle of inclusiveness, first inkling of diversity. Who was that strange child, that face at the rim Demanding vision? It\u2019s as if our tree contracted, Refusing the danger of renewal. A closing system. That face returns and returns where never expected: The Jewish woman in Chicago whose stare was rife With memory or that Aran widower unfurling his story. We seem to fold into each other, upsurges of a life Drawing me into a seamless time, their past A vibrancy of absence leaving its traces in me. Is the child at the rim every stranger I\u2019ve faced? & \n￼Beyond Ask me then and I\u2019m almost sure I\u2019d say A hand, a turn of shoulder, some voluptuous Bend of playfulness kept inviting my caress. Those days I talked of truth and beauty. It was your expression. Those eyes that welcomed Without reserve. Open-faced, so much a brother\u2019s Keeper. It\u2019s as though we surrendered each other\u2019s Freedom, freeing the other the more we succumbed. It was years later I thought of Dante\u2019s Beatrice, And how once you\u2019d chided me for making fun O f an old man. Who knows what he\u2019s undergone? A face is filtering light from beyond a face. You\u2019d seen transparence in a stranger\u2019s infinite ^gitze. I moved in your light to see the light. \n￼O'Siadhail 9-46 5/7/95 4:24 pm Page News It was a struggle, but he arrived just after one. Daniel George his father names him by telephone. An unbroken line. And so he enters our universe God\u2019s my judge, Soil-morker as his grandfathers. Who\u2019s he like? I try to imagine his countenance A little smudged, but finding its own structure From genes and traces, incessant recommencements Travelling towards a future. A recourse and rupture. It\u2019s as though two separatenesses had come together Blending their need with desire, a self and other, Some kind of surplus in a lovers\u2019 touch and go. Daniel George. One face of renewal and overflow. Yours and not yours. You are and are not your son. Fecundity\u2019s old riddle and a world moving on. / 15 \n￼Quartet These players nod and gleam as if they\u2019re seeing And hearing the other\u2019s expression, each leaning Into the fine-nerved strings, their whole being Vested in this interplay, this gamble on meaning. I remember a crescendo dream. We burned and burned. Maybe it\u2019s age. I grow in this mutual succumbing: Bow and pluck, phrase and breath of an earned And watchful passion, our face to face becoming. All shall be equal(m \\l s a ^ But nothing matches. Overlaps. Voice-overs. A sudden fertile digression Loops into our rousing silence. Something over-reaches Equality, a lived-in music shaping my compassion. The conversation dips and wanders and tenses again. A shining between faces, a listening inward and open.
