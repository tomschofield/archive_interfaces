Grim! Christopher Lee! That\u2019s how bad it is. People can all see my sickness, women run quickly into shops when they see my face. I\u2019m Dracula again looking for victims on platform 3, eyeing the beauties in the busde, in the tannoy haze. Look! here they come now with their tube bags. Watch me suck them dry! Listen to my invitation! \u2018Roll with me beauties off the edge of your lives\u2019 Nightmare. That\u2019s the only word for a date with me & that buffet girl\u2019s not interested, it\u2019s plain to see, \u2018it\u2019s the Spook,\u2019 she thinks, \u2018the Vampire of platform 3\u2019 \u2018it\u2019s the man with the pencilled-in hairline! quick! it\u2019s Christopher Lee! he\u2019s creepy & hairy, garlic!\u2019 So there you have it, grim isn\u2019t it, Christopher Lee, that\u2019s me, hanging out at the station since you left looking for blood, blood to forget you for a while, blood to be back home since we\u2019ve been apart, home in a box in Transylvania with the stakes beside my heart... 46 \n￼Cleary 23-52 13/7/93 6:57 pm Page 47 2 Revolution It\u2019s turn of the century Russia, ok? you\u2019re a Countess & I\u2019m a serf. a 00°) \u2022 Get the picture, a bo/ man with a scythe, out chopping fields with scythe for your heart knowing it\u2019s hopeless as the winter stings. Up in Petrograd you\u2019ll be getting restless in the snow, beside your bourgeois fire & maids who heat up all your muffs, help keep your feelings buried, subdued by the palace, majestic food, the grandeur of a thousand dinner parties to obscure me, to obscure you from my face that night in the lonely carriage, a samovar on the low light later in my shack, my bogland. So Peter will be telling me soon of revolution itSj & then we\u2019ll have to fight, my dear, on different sides. Your world will be turned upside-down, my darling & my voice will ache calling out to the hinterland before the begining of the end, the dust of our love trampled as the citizens storm the barricades. You won\u2019t ever escape me in exile either, on the meadow beside the Finnish lake so still... 47 \n￼Cleary 23-52 13/7/93 6:57 pm Page 48 3 Rot There\u2019s dry rot in the attic, sweetest, & we never speak, how are we supposed to sort out this rot then? There\u2019s dust everywhere & now in the attic this rot, we need treatment, sweetest, we need to see an expert. If only we could see the village handyman even, but he\u2019s out of town, poor simpleton, riding away over the hills on his bike with a lucky sixpence was the last heard of that fella, no handyman! No expert! So we\u2019ve got big problems here, my sweet, & I\u2019m no good with rot, I can grow things no problem, look at the hyacinths I planted sure, their radiance! but DIY? you may as well whistle something backwards! Who can lend us the readies, sweet, the dosh, the LSD? surely not the bank manager, my sweet, a lost cause. He\u2019s out on the green right now with his new putter & dry rot\u2019s the last thing he ever thinks about, not ours, not his, not anybody tnkman can save us. No money from the moneyman can save our dry rot. Have you even been up to the attic of late, my sweet? remember love beneath the candles, giggling at the beams? no, I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019ve been up there of late, my sweet, it\u2019s a wreck, devastation! not the dream home we seek. our attic is caving in, my sweet, & we never speak... 48 \n￼Cleary 23-52 13/7/93 6:57 pm Page 49 4 Bye bye love I\u2019m packing my heart off to boarding school, it just has to be done, I can\u2019t control it. Perhaps the stern brothers & nuns can help knock some degree of discipline into my heart. A cold shower at 5 in the morning, a 6 mile run through the mud & the mire, some meditation. Let my heart learn prayers for being so crazy! Let my heart scrub floors for penance! Discipline! Bed with no malted milk! No sugar! Not a spoonful of sugar will my heart be given, & I won\u2019t even send my heart a care package. No care packages, I\u2019m running my heart out of town. You big softie, heart, you snivelling wee weasel! Save all your tears & snotters for the nuns. Now I\u2019ll get to invite the neighbour in for champagne. I\u2019ll seduce the neighbour\u2019s wife effortlessly. I\u2019ll seduce the neighbour\u2019s mistress heartlessly while the neighbour groans & drinks my poison tea & my heart by then will have forgotten me... 49 \n￼Cleary 23-52 13/7/93 6:57 pm Page 50 :ft CAP \u2022 5 Black ice It\u2019s like there\u2019s been this massive car crash & our love has wrapped itself round a tree, or we\u2019ve toppled over completely on the hard shoulder, the tyres of strangers squirting us as they speed by. Mud & slime from puddles in our hearts on the M6, let\u2019s make it the M6, our love in heavy fog. So we should have gone by the B roads, my love, should have travelled by all the scenic routes, stopped for pints, stopped for plenty of bacon buns, smoked over tea & breakfasts in all the wild domains. But how we rush, we always rush & now we\u2019re comotose & the ambulance won\u2019t come, we\u2019ve had our 15 minutes, & that AA man is surely kind but what can we do? the dents on the bodywork like an earthquake\u2019s hit, the steering wheel all bent & petrol leaking. So we lie half-dead with our half-remembered prayers & that kind AA man can do nought, my love & no doctors either will just be happening along on their way to conventions. It won\u2019t be like the movies now, my dearest, not now, because ouraove is wrapped around the steel barrier & our blood is running thin, we\u2019re slipping away, my love, to some burnt out scrapyard, it\u2019s a migration upwards, up to Jesus with his roadmap & his pencil poised to sea*our fate- a place, Jesus,\u2019 he thought; \u2018Where can I find the place to take back their souls?\u2019 Aye, we\u2019re in deep water now, my dear, banjacksed, 50 -e \n￼Cleary 23-52 13/7/93 6:57 pm Page 51 up shit river with no paddle, up the grim M6, & that home in the hills we promised ourselves, my dear, is just over the rise if we could only make it, if fuel could be found or the ambulance did come miraculously. \u2018Look! here comes the ambulance men with their gleaming faces\u2019 I\u2019ll utter, our hands stretching out to each other in the mess & in the fractured air... 6 Mona I\u2019m living in this attic now with my new girlfriend, does that make you jealous? do you envy her?, my Mona. Her name\u2019s Mona, the bright elusive butterfly of love, & I\u2019ve packed in whiskey, the breath of Satan, since we met. At night when I\u2019m sad it\u2019s good to hear her fluttering & she hangs out on my windowledge in the slow afternoon. She preens herself endlessly & although she flaps in panic I wouldn\u2019t harm her, Mona\u2019s safe with me, I swear it! You mustn\u2019t think I wouldn\u2019t let her float away either, I let you float away, remember, the streets beyond our nest. A friendly neighbour is keeping our nest spick & span & look, I realise if we go back there it\u2019s without her. But you\u2019d like her, she\u2019s an orange shade I warm to, Mona\u2019s looking after me in her own wild mystical way. Together we look through your photos & she soothes me, beautiful Mona\u2019s my latest but you\u2019ll never be my ex. 51 \n￼Cleary 23-52 13/7/93 6:57 pm Page 52 One day we\u2019ll be back in that nest together, I know it! you can kick over as many cups of tea as you like, you can watch TV & ask dumb questions endlessly all night, you can get me to fetch hot pitta breads & peanut butter, I\u2019ll fetch the croissants too & the durex bill is mine, & all the days just lying about in our nest will be precious. Mona understands all this, don\u2019t fret, it\u2019s just a phase, anothe^phase we\u2019re going through, Mona & myself agree she\u2019ll fly one day beyond the factories, set us both free... 52 ","docTitle":"","docDate":"1993-07-13"},"meta":{"contentType":"text/raw","emVer":"7.1.1103.5","langIdVer":"DefaultLangId","processingVer":"CalaisJob01","submissionDate":"2014-07-01 08:47:20.805","submitterCode":"57b17a53-6e34-87b0-20ff-a419896f49c9","signature":"digestalg-1|gBi8s53tFKvhH991wmy7hWsw1SE=|R2ccKhMTwSg/aNElQqevNmswcNs2vzWNCXV5Oy1+vqzrMlldr/yTnQ==","language":"English"}},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/acb08abd-6a4e-32c9-8f1c-1df850c7f2aa/lid/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http://d.opencalais.com/lid/DefaultLangId/English"},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/4f33f1e1-e10e-3c2a-ae1e-4a7ee67290f2":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"IndustryTerm","name":"massive car crash","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/IndustryTerm","instances":[{"detection":"[50 :ft CAP \u2022 5 Black ice It\u2019s like there\u2019s been ]this massive car crash[ & our love has wrapped itself round a tree, or]","prefix":"50 :ft CAP \u2022 5 Black ice It\u2019s like there\u2019s been ","exact":"this massive car crash","suffix":" & our love has wrapped itself round a tree, or","offset":4411,"length":22}],"relevance":0.11},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/3b26195e-a828-3d1f-bc84-c018e1d8bc34":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"NaturalFeature","name":"Finnish lake","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/NaturalFeature","instances":[{"detection":"[escape me in exile either, on the meadow beside ]the Finnish lake[ so still... 47 \n￼Cleary 23-52 13/7/93 6:57 pm]","prefix":"escape me in exile either, on the meadow beside ","exact":"the Finnish lake","suffix":" so still... 47 \n￼Cleary 23-52 13/7/93 6:57 pm","offset":2087,"length":16}],"relevance":0.264},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/50b97ce2-1f4a-3cf5-8c4c-9a80124f7f61":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"RadioStation","name":"2 Revolution","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/RadioStation","instances":[{"detection":"[46 \n￼Cleary 23-52 13/7/93 6:57 pm Page 47 ]2 Revolution[ It\u2019s turn of the century Russia, ok? you\u2019re a]","prefix":"46 \n￼Cleary 23-52 13/7/93 6:57 pm Page 47 ","exact":"2 Revolution","suffix":" It\u2019s turn of the century Russia, ok? you\u2019re a","offset":1123,"length":12}],"relevance":0.291},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/7f0fc81a-494e-3124-a634-6a8a13e9dd46":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"Country","name":"Russia","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/Country","instances":[{"detection":"[ pm Page 47 2 Revolution It\u2019s turn of the century ]Russia[, ok? you\u2019re a Countess & I\u2019m a serf. a 00°) \u2022]","prefix":" pm Page 47 2 Revolution It\u2019s turn of the century ","exact":"Russia","suffix":", ok? you\u2019re a Countess & I\u2019m a serf. a 00°) \u2022","offset":1161,"length":6}],"relevance":0.291,"resolutions":[{"id":"http://d.opencalais.com/er/geo/country/ralg-geo1/1c625cc8-6f82-4660-a320-d185916e3c55","name":"Russia","latitude":"54.8270488441","longitude":"55.0423189997"}]},"http://d.opencalais.com/pershash-1/d0d086bc-ae4f-3b50-baab-604156a75f5c":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"Person","name":"Christopher Lee","persontype":"entertainment","nationality":"N/A","commonname":"Christopher Lee","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/Person","instances":[{"detection":"[station again since you left for Paris.
