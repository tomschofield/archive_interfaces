Hera\u2019s Spring 'Nothing mill be left o f Jeserac but a galaxy o f electrons frozen in the heart o f a crystal. I shall sleep, and without dreams. Then one day, perhaps a hundred thousand years from now, I shallfind myselfin a new body, meeting those who have chosen to be my guardians..A t first I will know nothing of Diaspar and will have no memories of what I was before. Those memories will slowly return, at the end ofmy infancy, and I will build upon them as I movefor  ward into my new cycle o f existence. \u2019 ARTHUR C. CLARKEj The City and the Stars Missing his noisy play around the house, and remembering the time was no doubt near, she hurried out, unkempt as she was, andfound him at last, pale-faced and tearstained, hunched on the weir bank - no fishing-rod in sight - plunged in himself, his pain. With a motherly tenderness she wiped his eyes with her skirt-hem; she knew; she gently questioned him; and said: Believe me, dear, though it will seem strange to you, I have wept too for all these things you mention - and others that may  be have not yet started to haunt you again. Do you recall, for instance, the dark coppery flowers on the low trees? the waterfalls, or methane-falls - call them what you like - leaping off cliffs? the strong, live winds, and violet sky flashing with great clouds? And I expect you have walked many a time with your husband on those mountain-slopes as bright as metal, with thunder laughing in the ground, and clear red flame exploding above you? I know / have \u2014though with, as it happens, a wife beside me - a dear woman...I too have been there, Jeserac; a terribly long time ago, but it\u2019s still precious to me. 23 \n￼-0 - lio'b Today isn\u2019t the time to convince you that these eroded hills, blue sky, green woods, not to mention the speckled fish you like catching, are themselves not unbeautiful...this first day, you\u2019ve a right to feel desperate. I recall myself (though how many others in between!) writhing in the ammonia- snow I\u2019d always thought of as home, and was to again - tormented by the globe your mind is filled with, shrieking at my sisters to leave me in peace! Poor mites, they ran off and told everyone that a yanu was inside me! - This, darling, was near Procyon, the light your father taught you to find last night. - Oh, don\u2019t think I don\u2019t understand; it\u2019s the beings you gave yourself in love to - not moons or cliffs! And the dull ache of this you must expect never to wholly leave you. How often one finds oneself wondering - and the worst of it\u2019s being completely unable to share your dark thoughts with anyone else - I where is, say, Kersti? - a granddaughter I once had somewhere in Boo|-«H*)tes; in which of the far-flung micro-files of our cosmic city Diaspar is that beloved pattern crystallised; and where will she \u2014or he- emerge again? Yet one knows there can be no answer. Only the dumb Selector knows that. Still, it\u2019s the way of Hera\u2019s Spring; we have to count our blessings. \u2014I see that too hasn\u2019t come back yet, dear! It would soon, so I may as well remind you. Ages and ages ago, on this very planet (in re-emerging here, we\u2019ve come home, in the deepest sense), men, who had previously \u2018died\u2019, as 24 Thomas 11-51 10/11/92 2:43 pm Page 24, \n￼Thomas 11-51 10/11/92 2:43 pm Page 25e, though they were cattle or sheep, found out the secret of immortality. ...Still doesn\u2019t bring it back? - Just vaguely! Well, anyway, after they\u2019d finished rejoicing, they found that, after all, the threatening shears were things they couldn\u2019t do without. It\u2019s said the daffodils withered in the poets\u2019 verses; nothing seemed beautiful when nothing would pass away! - in fact, they found the prospects so deadly they clamoured for death to be restored. Instead, their scientists thought up a middle way, called Hera\u2019s » Spring, (I don\u2019t know who gave it that name). But it came from the way Hera, \u2018queen of the heavens\u2019 (you\u2019ve heard of her in this world) renewed her virginity, that is her purity, each year, by bathing in the spring of Canathos. It fits. The spring we step into is the frozen heart of a crystal, from which we emerge, having just held our breaths, maybe a million years later. This first time is the worst, Jeserac dear - your homesickness, if you like, is focused, not radiated. When you have had, like me, almost as many parents alone as there are stars out on these sharp, moonless nights - in fact, when I look up, to whatever point in the sky, I know I\u2019ll face a dozen able to pierce through me, hazy or bright, each with a dozen bereavements - you\u2019ll find the ache is a thing you can\u2019t do without either, in some queer way... But here I am, talking as if I\u2019m antique, instead of being quite a youngster in the city, not all that much older or wiser than your small brother Helderr, whose first world this 25 \n￼Thomas 11-51 10/11/92 2:43 pm Page 26, ? is! - and who, if I know anything, has woken up howling for my milk by this time! You stay here, Jeserac; come home to us when you feel ready, or hungry! Pomegranate Each year more clearly you can see her dark flowers wither to the sick light, or crush to our tighter embrace, as she picks up her bag and her coat, drifts out to face the statutory six-months with her mother. She turns to my heart\u2019s cog; rounded, no longer the child the courts shared between us, as a pomegranate cleft: small need any more for the fury who would have left me nothing...though God knows I have never reviled her. \u2018Be good to her,\u2019 I say, this morning; \u2018give her my \u2014®(I cannot finish). \u2018And - forget me while you\u2019re there.\u2019 \u2018You both say that!\u2019 She flicks her eyes...\u2018Father, must I go?\u2019 My green shoot, Kore, dawdles now at the brightening river\u2019s ferry - waves once - head bent, March uncabling her hair - then shoulders her bag, full of books I\u2019ll expect her to know. 26 / \n￼Thomas 11-51 10/11/92 2:43 pm Page 27. Cygnus A Removing hairgrips, nail-varnish, pensively brushing Black hair down to the black Bra, scattering a thick perfume on the night, You\u2019ve time to read me pointed texts From the Gideons\u2019 Bible propped by the red-stained kleenex Till I must shut my eyes tight While you slip Off (still that ludicrous reserve) Your diaphanous half-slip. But I prefer to gaze over the dark rooftops And talk to you over my shoulder. Somewhere out there, love, near-neighbour Rigel Winks its white Chaucerian light From Orion\u2019s heel; taking its petty flight From the peaks of the Eagle Burning through Hitler, by Deneb and Altair, Falls Vega\u2019s vulturous blue; Cambering Perseus covers half the sky, His spring from the weeping, huddled sisters, To see if he can reach Andromeda Before the formless monster lands - Cassiopeia stretches out her hands; And out there too\u2019s the glare O f yellow Capella And red, bull-eyed Aldebaran. Yet since, sweet, all my stellar Friends are in fact outshone and liquidated By the sun streaming from the green shade Suspended on this window over flickers of you, I let myself go on and on Past Deneb, into the dark breast of the Swan Where only the radio- T elescope, Picking up its grating noises Has any real hope 27 \n￼Thomas 11-51 10/11/92 2:44 pm Page 28/ Of finding out that such a thing exists - To a celestial catastrophe Greater than most at various times enacted In this Trust House - a cataclysm Unforeseeable by their worst pessimism - T o two galaxies attracted Into each other At a slow thousand miles a second Transformed to a smother Which astronomers cannot untangle; Cygnus A. ...So girlish, now that your hollow mouth has shed its lipstick flavour, you hold my hand Preventively, I kiss h!ack\\hair, Your eyes shut tight in pseudo-tragic prayer, Your weekend penates and My cupidon Clutter the bedside-table beside The white text ofStJohn. What must it be to have been born inside Such a fantastic complication - To pull aside a Cygnian tryst-house curtain And watch the overwhelming merge As whistling suns and planets all converge! For a moment to feel uncertain If one\u2019s discrete Galaxy will ever emerge With all its stars complete, But only for a moment - the chances are That not two single stars will get Too entangled, as the run-through takes its course In the next millenium; no glacial Fate is ready, sweet, to quench an outer-spatial Swan-light, though scores O f spheres sail by Each second - blues, golds and reds In a greased, fabulous sky. 28 \n￼1 10/11/92 2:44 pm Page 29, We\u2019re sure to see two \u2018silver plates\u2019 unpair Round the Year of our Lord 90,000 - Though, really, five hundred million years ago These \u2018lovers\u2019 fled away, despite Curiosity at Jodrell Bank tonight; No doubt by this time snow Has covered over Has heard the excuse of lovers: \u2018But that was in another galaxy, And besides, the star is dead!\u2019 While on live red-dwarfs, other will see St John Shine in your eyes, an aeon hence, Recording, with their brilliant instruments, That the red-shift heaven\u2019s undergone So shyly, doesn\u2019t veil Completely the Magellanic Cloud, Though all the space-trips fail. / 29 \n￼I3(£> / Requiem for Aberfan On 21 October in the Welsh coal-mining village ofAberfan, Tip number 7, containing waste or slurry from the mine, slipped and overwhelmed Pantglas Junior School. Twenty-eight adults and 116 children were killed: a generation. Magnates whose sweated legions crucified The valleys, washed their soft white hands, although The children died before they died. Brethren who rode their God in on the tide O f weeping, hawk this good comfort, that we owe Our deaths to One on green hill crucified. The child whose dream, the child whose drawing tried To tell somebody that the hill would flow, Knew that they died before they died. Workmen who chose and staked this mountainside, Their ankles lush with streams, a school below, Learn on what green hill they were crucified. Sleepers who from their sheets saw the coal slide And bury, seven nights before it happened, know The children died before they died. Mothers, whose off-to-death sharp voices denied Fevers and fancies, following at each cock-crow The road they drove them to be crucified, Die on the ninth-hour before they died. 30 Thomas 11-51 10/11/92 2:45 pm Page 30, \n￼Thomas 11-51 10/11/92 2:47 pm Page_31^^_ II. There was no keeping out, that day, or keeping in Either. They set up roadblocks, but you couldn\u2019t stop All Britain pitching in and trying to help. Or gawp. I stopped one car myself, a whole family, From the Midlands, \u2018Is this the place where all those kids Are buried?\u2019 he said. But mostly they wanted to help, Anything they could do. Which wasn\u2019t much. They didn\u2019t have a chance, you see, didn\u2019t have a chance... Yet, you couldn\u2019t seem to keep them in. The children. Not all that lot could. My missus and me, we saw David A score of times, I suppose, that Friday. He was everywhere! Running up to the front-door, about to bang it shut, About to turn the corner. Always about to, always three of us, In the road, in the crowd. Once, I still swear I did see him, In Moy Road, then he vanished. There were the rumours, you see, Of some being found alive. The whole terrace was like that, Full of them. No, you couldn\u2019t shut them in. It was like Holes in the slurry you couldn\u2019t see. There were More kids about the place than normal, I\u2019d say. Funny, it was the same even when I\u2019d found David In Bethania. Not a mark on him, there wasn\u2019t. Like a doll. We still hoped. It hadn\u2019t happened, do you know? III. The Father The day, you came, I felt her turn from me. Absence, fullbreasted, coasting at my side, Straining for different hungers - rightfully. With no regrets, my pit-black spirit died And rose like waste through galleries of you. Cast like a tip, I saw and sang my pride, The first-born, inexhaustible, the new Seam, richer, deeper than all Rhondda. A man Gets born again out of his wife, I knew, 31 \n￼Thomas 11-51 10/11/92 2:47 pm Page 32,e What did it matter that the more you ran Into your mother\u2019s heart, the closer I felt iTo an eighth spewed cone outtopping Aberfan? With no regrets. And yet have I not knelt Begging God that His curse should overwhelm Me also, so confirmed was I in guilt At having willed this on you, in some dream I had forgotten maybe. When, as the arc- Lights flickered on the ant-hill, I heard your scream Rise faintly from a desk, miles deep, the black Slurry was in myself. Why did we pause? Now, when the shuddering cage transports us back To that rise up to hell - untold, we knew \u2014 Always, I hear, faintly, unreachably, You cry where my own evil fell on you. IV. The Brother I steal into his room, with my pack of cards, A. And play\\^ patience under his photo, Hoping to tempt him. I get tired of it. It never comes out. So I go to the mountain, quite a lot. I remember we had a story once About how somebody led these children into the mountain, And there was a lame boy who couldn\u2019t go. Mummy doesn\u2019t know, but they have parties in the grave. Last night, in my sleep, I heard it. I was in disgrace for telling on them, but I didn\u2019t. Robert called me, Sissy. The terrace is empty. All summer it\u2019s Sunday. If I showed him my cards, offered to let him win Only so he would play with me, play, Would he let me in? 32 ","docTitle":"","docDate":"1992-10-11"},"meta":{"contentType":"text/raw","emVer":"7.1.1103.5","langIdVer":"DefaultLangId","processingVer":"CalaisJob01","submissionDate":"2014-07-01 09:57:17.089","submitterCode":"57b17a53-6e34-87b0-20ff-a419896f49c9","signature":"digestalg-1|Ws5C4X0m4Pv8NtqjHn8tFSbbaTQ=|A/F3UOqmZS94waSDQgw2T0+UmGJrjMjOLKYf+aV8HAw5hdxrXhzL+Q==","language":"English"}},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/f69ccfbf-f3b8-34f8-a3b0-1c776a98abe7/lid/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http://d.opencalais.com/lid/DefaultLangId/English"},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/c3a12a9a-1663-3642-a854-991fa561bae8":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"IndustryTerm","name":"weir bank","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/IndustryTerm","instances":[{"detection":"[ last, pale-faced and tearstained, hunched on the ]weir bank[ - no fishing-rod in sight - plunged in himself,]","prefix":" last, pale-faced and tearstained, hunched on the ","exact":"weir bank","suffix":" - no fishing-rod in sight - plunged in himself,","offset":784,"length":9}],"relevance":0.309},"http://d.opencalais.com/pershash-1/86218076-3b6a-364c-a8d3-5d6cfa1df4dc":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"Person","name":"Rigel Winks","persontype":"N/A","nationality":"N/A","commonname":"Rigel Winks","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/Person","instances":[{"detection":"[Somewhere out there, love, near-neighbour ]Rigel Winks[ its white Chaucerian light From Orion\u2019s heel;]","prefix":"Somewhere out there, love, near-neighbour ","exact":"Rigel Winks","suffix":" its white Chaucerian light From Orion\u2019s heel;","offset":6346,"length":11}],"relevance":0.206},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/41722ca4-8761-37de-974e-41c30d06b188":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"Organization","name":"Pantglas Junior School","organizationtype":"N/A","nationality":"N/A","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/Organization","instances":[{"detection":"[ or slurry from the mine, slipped and overwhelmed ]Pantglas Junior School[.
