These frogs, child\u2019s eye size or smaller, baby\u2019s thumbnails, black in the dusk, spatter across the road in hundreds, feeling their landlegs. Climbing the road we dodder like drunks on stairs reluctant to trust another foot but shoved by weight to land it somewhere. Frogs die in ones and pairs and multiples and keep on coming. They flick across wet tarmac from the dripping grass to a flat finish. On then, knowing no other way, a risk a yard, and even our small collisions, elbows, shoulders, unbalance and betray us. We move confused, and envy those thick boots that come down hard and walk direct. 62 ","docTitle":"","docDate":"2014-07-01 09:46:50.146"},"meta":{"contentType":"text/raw","emVer":"7.1.1103.5","langIdVer":"DefaultLangId","processingVer":"CalaisJob01","submissionDate":"2014-07-01 09:46:49.990","submitterCode":"57b17a53-6e34-87b0-20ff-a419896f49c9","signature":"digestalg-1|8LV2VnKPe2RaYZm10b2TIpUOwiI=|TssWz1/ii2EV4shOfARQMz+RHOhji7568PoH7QCZJ2wapeFpnFljDw==","language":"English"}},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/bfa10220-8f51-389e-94dc-98396edd228f/cat/1":{"_typeGroup":"topics","category":"http://d.opencalais.com/cat/Calais/Hospitality_Recreation","classifierName":"Calais","categoryName":"Hospitality_Recreation","score":0.948},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/bfa10220-8f51-389e-94dc-98396edd228f/lid/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http://d.opencalais.com/lid/DefaultLangId/English"}}
