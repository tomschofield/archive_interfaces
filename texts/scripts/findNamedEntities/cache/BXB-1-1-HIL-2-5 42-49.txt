He was like a butcher with a knife. I followed him. My little knock - so high-pitched, so final. Remembering what? Somebody saying O f course, if it\u2019s your first gala, you will be nervous. He smiled, and singed my hair with his gold-plated cigarette-lighter. The doctor came too late. It was snowing. He put a box of chocolates on my bed, and kissed my cheek. You\u2019re a good girl, he said. Cu His long white skirts, his polished shoes, his soft pink hands that never touched my lips. He sent me photographs of naked men on diving boards and decks of yachts. Crepusculo - Ibiza. Shell Bay. Torquay. La carte postale de Vamitie.

The hot pipes go tick tick and this man I hardly know keeps turning me over and over like the hunter on the radio who came across a mummy while on holiday in Greenland.

He cut off her black underclothes and took them home to his father who, being afraid of ghosts, fed them into the Garbage Guzzler he had just bought. \n￼Hill Trembling 25-58 3/2/94 1:06 pm Page 46 The Bath He presses an oval of soap into the palm of his hand and twirls the bristles in the violet foam until it quilts his fingers like the snow where trappers crawl to pull the hairs from little Russian weasels. I lie under the greying water; drape my flannel on my curls like palls, or like the coloured coats that poodles wear; or muslin lain on cheese in dingy larders to protect it from the flies. Not that he\u2019s likely to look: his only joy\u2019s his - twizzle twizzle twizzle - obsessive pirouettes. Then I remember He\u2019s been deadfor weeks. I roll over in the water thoughtfully, feeling - not lonely exactly - more like a floating pear-half having warm chocolate sauce poured over me. 46 -0 - \n￼Hill Trembling 25-58 3/2/94 1:06 pm Rase 48 Mother Stone My father was a tall man who approved of beating, but my mother, like a mother stone, preferred us to be sitting in a small room lined with damson-coloured velvet thinking quietly to ourselves, undisturbed; everything was slow and beautiful when we were being punished: all we had to do was watch the dark-red petals\u2019 roses press against each other in a slight breeze on the window pane, and blossoms fall in silence from the cherry tree; and now my son is lying in a long white shirt across our eiderdown, trying to stay awake, and fingering my spine\u2019s shell pink as if I were a beach and he were blades of marram grass in drifts of sand. I dab my face with cream that smells of cucumber and whisper in a distant milky voice O f course I \u2019ll wake you up when he comes', and then his eyelids close, and in his self-created darkness he is following a big car on a motorway at night, it turns into the driveway to the house, and presently the driver gets out: it is only a bear in the moonlight, walking on the lavender beds. 48 0- -0 \n￼Hill Trembling 25-58 3/2/94 1:06 pm Raje 47 Eating Chocolates in the Dark And after that, the diaries stop. We think he went to his grandmother\u2019s, whom he adored apparently. They sat on her bed with the lights turned off, and ate chocolates, and listened to the sea. It was a kind of ritual they both found very comforting. Her other love was hyacinths. He said he didn\u2019t like them, and asked her to take them away. And then he started telling her about a lost eskimo who paddled up the Don in a kayak. He was dressed in sealskin, and very tired. After a few days, he caught a cold and died. The dip dip dip of the little boat, and his sad story-telling voice, were like a lullaby, and she was asleep, or nearly asleep, when suddenly he asked her if she believed in God. (She told me all this quite openly - the old Russian grandmother, half lying back on her cushions. Perhaps I shouldn\u2019t say this, she said, but listen to me for a moment - if you wake up, and feel something fat like a puppy wriggling between your legs, you\u2019re not going to say it\u2019s God, or the answer to all your questions, or Love, are you? It\u2019s sex! It was the same for him.) -e- 47 \n￼Hill Trembling 25-58 3/2/94 1:06 pm ROage 49 No one No one is to touch me but the Lord. His fingertips caress me like a knife.
