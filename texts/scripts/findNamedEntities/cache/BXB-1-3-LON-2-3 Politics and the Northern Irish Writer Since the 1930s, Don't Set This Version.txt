I argued that its strength partly derives from its mongrel qualities, from the creative interaction rather than political antagonism of different literary and cultural traditions. At question  time one student cut through all this obvious waffle. He asked: 'which of these poets supports the armed struggle?1 I might have replied that poetry7 is no more likely to support euphemism, than to echo the rhetoric of '7or God and Ulster'. But I fell back feebly on 'It's net as simple as that'. This short paper is an elaboration of 'Its not as simple as that'. F.pr greater comnlexi tv, we need perspectives beyond the literary Boao ?3>j' generations from ^Triel to|Muidocn, usually featured in the 'Art and Troubles' spotlight. So I will outline a viaw of relations between writing and toiitics in Northern Ireland from 19cC to I960, the year when performance of Sam Thomeson's shioT-ard olay Over the Bridge consummated such relations. Amena those who Lt out in the Dark Ages before the world media arrived are; the poet John Hewitt 'my main subject', the novelist Sam Hanna Beil, and John 3oyd, playwright end autobiographer. Ail are now in their seventies and politically left wing. I am concentrating on writers from a Protestant background because their political consciousness illuminates the darkest area. Bat first, a word about their expatriate concenpdrary Louis MacNeice. As the best writer, his poetry and criticism are often paradigmatic. That MacNeice's aesthetic has continuing consequences is recognised even by T.\u2018j political 'AyMe.cu .

ButtheattackreflectsMacNeice\u2019?own engagementwith the unique double idac\u2019cgical pressure on his poetry from Irish Nationalism and English Marxism. \"his makes him, in my view, the only Irish poor who -frpt t'OH. \n￼approaches Yeats as a thinker on art and politics,,ijary of Cathleen Oi Ho'uiifian since 'we love her for ever and hate our neighbour', MacNeice did not fall for the alternative political whereby 'Marx was to the poets of 2 the thirties what Rousseau was to the poets of the Romantic Revival,' Poetry (1938) takes a democratic Socialist view of as not esoteric 'luxury-writing' but functional, communal and sympathetic to 'those forces which 3 at the moment make for progress'. But MacNeice's preface emphasises: 'Propaganda ,i the extreme development of critical poetry, is also the defeat of criticism1. l \u2022£. And he concludes: 'for the poet, any belief, any creed (and beliefs and creeds tend to be a p/hcfti ) should be compromised with his own individual observation. . tl\\ tic c^jlx (MenofactionincertaincjrttvreMCfimaybenefit^ .beingunobservantor uncritical, but if the poet is to be required to do this he may as well give up writing and merely act.)

Yeats (1941), further challenged by his subject and by the seeming irrelevance of all poetry once Germany had invaded Poland. He finally argues for poetry having some political effects, as Yeats's did; but against the Marxist 'fallacy' of 'thinking that it is the function of art to make things happen and that the effect of art upon actions is something either direct or calculable.'\"* This conclusion is partly triggered by MacNeice's reaction to political poetry in Ireland after Yeats, specifically Leslie Daiken's committed anthology Goodbye, Twilight ( I83b ). John Hewitt reviewed the anthology, and their judgments -coincide. MacNeicedescribesGoodbye,Twilightas'a collection ofproletarian poems - some communist, some Irish republican, and all written in a defiant spirit of opposition ... a violent reaction against Yeats and all that he stood for'. He notes the mixture of 'the conventional utterance of the international working class' with poems 'that are still £ blatantly nationalistic and ... even devoutly Roman Catholic'. Hewitt, : Marxist than MacNeice and a lifelong advocate of'pro letarian' poetry, longs MacNeice Modern \n￼for 'a r \u201d n l s d a r ^ and singing contribution ... from the workers and peasants'.^ But he shares MacNeice's conviction that just as all art is not propaganda.so not all propaganda is art. And he too finds the anthology's politics queryi/y its -SubHt-le\u201d'Sonqg a.f fce Sfcoqqlt in d confused^ Because of 'Too much weight on the Southern contributions', 'the Irish Straggle becomes the Free State or Republican Struggle'. Whereas: 'The Iri:sh Struggle has many varieties and is being fought out in Derry and Strabane, in Sandy Row and Short Strand'.8 Ultimately Hewitt, like MacNeice, accepts /eats as the poet to beat, even if your own opinions radically diverge from his- 'if anyone can make poetry of the stuff of politics he can «<>« g Stand on his shoulders and there get your wider vision'. Fifty years on, some Field Day publications might disc b e caWeo. Goodbye,Twilight. It seems relevant that in the late thirties MdcNeice and Hewitt felt; that the Irish writers obligation to politics was not ideologically straightforward, that unexplored contradictions precluded shortcuts to ' a wi'ier vision', and that Yeats could still be of use in the matter. This implies in agenda for literary and social development as contrasted with the politica. Impabence of Goodhye, Twilight. It may follow that we should not short-circuit literary history between 1921 and 1969, which among other things means assimilating MacNeice and Hewitt.

J In default of politics, Irish literature after Partition seems to have constituted itself an opposition to monolith:.', ruling ideologies South and North: ideologies which in different ways \n￼and for different reasons censored literature. The Bell itself was, ironically, one of the few flourishing all-Ireland InaXihCionS^ It took an empirical interest in Ulster life and helped Hewitt, Hanna Bell, W.R.

However, with the war South and North. wtTc d i f f e r **itr iic (o tio A S * some Belfast writers felt they needed a local outlet too. Thus Lagan was founded in 1943 by Boyd, Hanna Bell and Bob Davidson. I'll come back to Lagan. But first, the thirties political background to its founding. Politics preceded literature perhaps because the tradition of writers emigrating, to escape as much as Unionism, meant that intellectual dissent within the North was once again starting virtually from scratch. Two lines from Autumn Journal condense what the would-be Ulster writers was up against; 'A culture built upon profit;/ Free speech nipped in the bud'. Buds of dissent did not only sprout from the Nationalist objection to the state's existence and conduct. The focus for Belfast dissidents in the early thirties in fact promised a whole political and literary brave new world. It was David M cLean's Progressive Bookshop in Union Street, Sam Hanna Bell describes the Unionist atmosphere of the time as 'so clty/odj that almost anything came as a relief.' 13 John Boyd recalls; 'we despised Belfast for its political and religious obscurantism,' and that John Hewitt 'was the centre of a small circle of left wingers who thought the intellectual life of the city stagnant and who, by political action and thought^were trying to stir 14 things up.' with trade union activists in his family. He, Hewitt and Bell, like Sam Ttiompson later, all have records of involvement in socialist groups. Socialism undent'd horizons. As well as the living Belfast, there was fuller contact with the British left than exists nowadays, Clydeijide. The Left Book Club dispatched literary- Boyd himself was a working-class scholarship boy from Ballymacarstt, \n￼(Himes' political food-parcels to Ulster's starved intellectuals, and members\u2019^were reputed to be on R.U.C. Lists. The Spanish Civil War engaged their ;rnayl.iaficns as it did MacNeice's, and Basque and .Jewish refugees invigorated the atmosphere. Later, members of the services boosted the circulation of Lagan. In 1942 visiting poets contributed to an anthology in aid of the Russian Red Cross published by The Socialist Party. The Bell reviewer, while noting that 'most of the poems rare] not propaganda', marvelled: 'As far as I know this is the first time in the history of politics or of poetry that a political party has disinterestedly published a book of poems.'^ In fact Sam Hanna Bell was at this time an editor of Labour; Progress ; while Hewitt had been literary editor of the Communist. Irish Democrat for which John Boyd also wrote. inaugural 'Manifesto' appealed for working-class writing and urged 'Proletarian writers of Ireland Unite.' We must mobilise against War and Fascism. '^ To focus on Hewitt's public activity during the thirties. The pacifism in that manifesto reflects his work in the Peace League. In 1934 he wrote a KeCtfUi'tin^ article which the League's 'non-sectarian and non-political nature.' However, he acknowledges the paradox of 'working for international peace Jwhile] ... in my native city, Catholics were burnt out of 18 the York Street area.' Hewitt wrote a poem about the burnings. But 'The Bloody Brae' (1936') is the work of that period which he places alongside 'The Colony' ''1950) as most accurately expressing 'my attitude to the major problem 19 of my native province'. Cromwellian soldier constantly relives the historic blood-guilt of the planter and encounters the ghost of a woman he killed. More practically, Hewitt had already assisted a National Council -fop. Civil Liberties investigation into the Special,Powers Act. This taught him 'the nature of state authority and its techniques of the opened letter and the tapped telephone'. 20 But opposition to the regime did not give priority to explicitly Republican politics. Hewitt's political starting-point had been that 'the Unionists were a Right- Wing offshoot of the British Tory Party, who ... fought every election on the In this short Yeatsian verse-drama cx former \n￼Border, and.,the Nationalists ... were merely obsolete clansmen ready with old slogans, moving in an irrelevant dream, utterly without the smallest fig- leaf of a social policy. So my concern went to the Laboop. Party .., the party of Sam Kyle and Billy McMullen, who had a policy about \"the ownership of the *21 means of production, distribution and exchange.\" Obviously this raises the ghost of Connolly, and his disputed will and testament to the Irish Left. Kyle and McMullen were elected to Stormont in the twenties after a campaign during which Labouranti-Partitionists had put the border on the back burner-* But Connolly's theoretical bypassing of the religious question, instinct for Irish Catholic cohesion, and romance with the Gaelic nation at the expense of the 'hybrid Irishman' 2\"> render unsurpfwsih^ his limited sympathy with the skilled Belfast Protestant working class. This class h a s indeed proved unsympathetically prone to put Unionism before trade unionism when eXncsTkd. to do so. Over the Bridge dramatises the historical impotence of socialist ideals in the face of sectarian violence. However, traditional Connollyite concepts may at once over-stress Protestant workers as manipulated dupes, and over-mytholog/fe working-class solidarity 23 during essentially economic campaigns like the Outdoor Relief Strike. Peadar O'Donnell noted that 'it is often in the name of his fierce Orange 24 Henry Patterson argues that fuller analysis of Orange and Unionist politics 'might have prevented with a nationalist or republican position'. 25 This is relevant to middle-class socialist writers in Belfast and the grounds of their opposition to Unionism. It relates to Hewitt's discovery that Goodbye, Twilight was not uncomplicatedly ' 26 'our stuff, the product of the Left Irish today'. While regretting partition and criticising discrimination, socialists and writers had special reasons for finding the Free State uncongenial in the 1930s, even as compared with Northern Ireland. MacNeice's 'Eclogue from Iceland' contains a reference to 'Connolly/ Vilified now by the gangs of Catholic Action.' belief that Tan Orangeman] enters a progressive fight'. _(1*3 CfaiS o«dfoefdrig/iju^ the easy identification of intransigent class opposition to bourgeois Unionism \n￼The attitudes of Hewitt, Bell and Boyd contrast with those of an olderwriter,theProtestantRepublicanDenisIreland.One of fboSc? convt&k j-hc Tht CCncjrt:jucten TTieyJCi^i mc/ie ttian Ttxc c-tc. th^-i nt'r.s left, \">''i iccl!-nur*trci essayist and pamphleteer wrote brave, elegant but somewhat repetitious polemics with titles like Six Counties in Search of a Nation.

Certainly Connolly's identification of '98 with prospective pan-Irish socialist brotherhood so far builds a shaky house on shaky foundations. Bell and Hewitt, emphasise the proto-socialism of the Northern rebellion- much more than the patriotic adventure. Bell, who calls his younger self 'a radical with faint 29 No socialist, Ireland rejected 'Connolly Nationalist colouration' and 'a nostalgic hankering for 1798' Presbyterian radicals attractive partly as an alternative to most versions of Nationalism then on offer. His historical novel A Man Flourishing C1973\"> charts the moral decline of a rural United Irishman into a Belfast businessman enim<ttl in prudential religion and 'A culture built upon profit'. But this crit'que of Presbyterianism gone rotten does not automatically tnshtimc1 a vision of Irish unity. The fallen hero's ultimate sin is that he becomes a strike  breaker. Similarly, Hewitt's favourite United Irishman is not Tone but James HopettheweaverofTemplepatrick. HesalutesHopetogetherwithWilliam Thompson as 'the brave old pre-^larx Marxists of Ireland.'^ Hope slots into Hewitt's pantheon alongside Cobbett, Paine, the Diggers, the Levellers, the Chartists and William Morris - a different Morris from Yeats's. As Hewitt came to recognise, this is as much an imaginative as a political or intellectual pecKQRte* However, I think Jack Foster goes too i far in arguing that Hewitt's radicalism 'stiffened... into conservatiS\u2019/n , and that 7. found the \n￼'His thirties socialism rings truer'.31 Hewitt's socialism did not end with the thirties, although his Marxism weakened. I would suggest that . in the forties he and others converted rather than diverted political aims and energies into cultural channels which might accelerate a progressive flow. Peadar O'Donnell wrote in 1942: 'It is not really very important whether Belfast writers speak from the Stormont camp or from the Custom House Steps: aBalzacwouldperhapsbemoredestructivethana^ola. Whatisvitally important is that Belfast writers should write. But they need more than a 32 magazine. They need a full size literary movement'. other than modest beginnings. But its impulse if not achievement was Balzacian, complementing O'Faolain's ambition to 'blueprint the society in place of theorising about Irishness. 33 A prominent mode, as in The Bell, was the idiomatic social-realist short story,John Boyds editorials, while pleading against '\"reportage\" that tries too obviously to a/ign us with a political group',34 keep social ends in view: 'the struggle for a way of writing is part of the struggle for a way of life'. 35 Hewitt's ideology of this struggle was Regionalism. He drew on various sources: the theory of Lewis Mumford and others, the practice of Estyn Evans in Irish Heritage, deep knowledge of his Ulster literary sires, contemporary movements in Scotland and Wales, the historical precedent of New England, the example of Robert Frost. Hewitt's idea Icn^ in his^poem'Freehold' of 'a well compacted space' proof '/Against the anthill and the beehive state' has parallels with Hubert Butler's Kilkenny patriotism in Escape from the Anthill. This itself looks back to the 'richly creative' 36 Hewitt's essay 'Regionalism; The Last Chance ^'1947') - last chance for humanity rather than for Ireland - ends with the political vistas to which he saw Regionalism returning full circle 'Ulster, considered as a Region, and not as symbol of any particular creed, can, I believe, command the loyalty of every one of its inhabitants. For Regional identity does not preclude, rather it requires, membership of a larger association. And, whether that association be, as I hope, of a Federated parochialism of the Irish Literary Revival. ■J British Isles, or of a Federal Ireland, o u t of that loyalty to our own place, Lagan always disclaimed \n￼rooted in honest history, in familiar folkways and knowledge, phrased in our own dialect, there should emerge a culture and an attitude individual and '37 > distinctive. It would be a pity to reduce Hewitts habitual insistence on 'rootedness', to a crypto-Unionist genealogy of the planters' territor/«i claim. His Regionalism, even including its ftictCflal frontiers, Mi'S open and open-ended. Like Butler's Anglo-Irish parochialism, it is a version of love of rather than^power. Affronted Nationalism should remember that Unionists them  selves have always paranoiacally perceived Ulster local culture, Scots or Irish or both, as the Trojan horse for an Irish national culture. This is abundantly clear from Rex Cathcart's history of the BBC in Northern Ireland, suitably titled The Most Contrary Region C1984).38 To some Unionists, safe culturo.! Hurrt,L£0.\u2019 Ht-lJIL ambition constitutes the Ulster Orchestra playing in London before the Queen Mother. Nor should we forget that Hewitt in 1953 was made a political scapegoat for his socialist and literary alleg&ncies (to Catholic writers). Unionists conspired to deny him the directorship of the Ulster Museum and Art Gallery. 39 What remains vibrant in Hewitt's prose and poetry of the previous decade is the sense of cultural mission. Vivian Mercier has traced the evangelical connections of the Irish Literary Revival. An evangelical spirit may link the Hewitt who urged proletarian writers to mobilise, with the Hewitt who later touchingly tried to enthuse Ulster Young Farmers about their poetic heritage, in a journal otherwise devoid Tb flax policy.^\" Behind both incarnations lurks Alexander Irvine, the Antrim-born preacher, social reformer and writer. Irvine in Hewitt's words 'had exposed the outrages of the chain-gangs in the Southern 4i r States [and] ... stood shoulder to shoulder with Jack London'. /Hewitt in the I\u2014* early thirties was inspired first by a stVrvtcn of Irvine's then by a speech at the Labour Hall which celebrated 'the agitator Christ, and the communism of the early disciples'. Then there was a private occasion when Irvine told him that in Ulster 'Someone was needed to say the unpopular things^ to maintain the >LA imperilled values. Hewitt turned this episode into a short story called 'The Laying on of Hands'.42 \n￼From the late forties a small number of cultural missionaries wereatworkinvarioussavagequarters. ThoughHewittabandonedRegionalism as a coherent theory it served or caught its time. In the BBC, Bell and Boyd functioned as creative subversives or subversive creators. The North is still culturally as well as politically far from '$aved'. Nevertheless some progress can be measured by the multiple links between what might be termed the first phase of a literary movement and subsequent developments. One such is that Seamus Heaney as an undergraduate made a study of Lagan and its successor Rann. And when Hewitt reviewed Death of a Nat oKcihst in 1966, he employed the value-terms of his earlier Regionalism: 'actual ... grounded ... concrete ... firm ... spare'. He also relate^ Heaney to local Ulster writers like Michael McLaverty and Peadar 0'Donnell;who 'inhabit the same region of 43 our national feeling'. Cultural progress may of course be overtaken or taken over by political events - as was the Gaelic League in 1915. The test is whether it can encompass them rather than evade, or surrender artistic autonomy. Over the Bridge marks one junctJ6C where culture and politics effectively reunited and *^6/1. a famous victory over the Unionist establishment which attempted to suppress the play. Thompson, the working-class socialist who shattered Unionist censorship in a way from which it never quite recovered, was discovered and encouraged by Sam Hanna Bell. As for Hewitt, his reaction to 1969 from English exile proves that no writer was more politically equipped or entitled to tell Unionists 'I told you so'. [^His medium in An Ulster Reckoning is, like Thompson's, plain speech: perhaps the only medium in which - as Orwell believed - really specific political points can be made.J , 44 Hewitt s just-published collection Freehold reprints both 'The Bloody Brae', product of the pessimistically political thirties, and the title- poem, product of the optimistically cultural forties. It also contains two poems which indicate his understanding of how cultural vision, to retain its own integrity, must accept the challenge of political forces.
