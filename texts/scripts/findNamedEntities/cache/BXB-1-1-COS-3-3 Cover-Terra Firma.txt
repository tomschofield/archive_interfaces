NOTES KILMARNOCKEDITION: theFirstEditionofBums'Poems,chieflyinthe Scottish dialect [pub.1786], TEMAORI:TheTeMaori(TaongaMaori/TreasuresoftheMaori) Exhibition in the 1980's launched Maori society and culture on the world. The poem is indebted to Carol O'Biso's remarkable account of its American tour, First Light [Heinemann, 1987]. AIR AND WATER: John Muir [1838-1914] was eleven when his father emigrated from Dunbar to America. There he became an explorer, naturalistandauthor,renownedasthe\"fatherofConservation\". My interest was rekindled by directing James Rankin's radio play Yosemite. NORMAN COLLIE AT SLIGACHAN INN: Norman Collie [1859-1942]: mountain climber and pioneer, who as a biochemist discovered the properties of neon. A.F.Mummery died on Nanga Parbat; and controversy followed the lossoffourofEdwardWhymper'spartyontheMatterhorn. Theprefatory quote is from a chapter heading in Noirman Collie, a life in two worlds by Christine Mill [AUP, 1987]. CONTRASTS: Hamilton Mausoleum, with its 15-second echo, was built by the 10th Duke to house himself and his ancestors. Chatelherault, the ducal hunting-lodge, dates from the 1730's: burnt and vandalised earlier this century, it was subsequently acquired by the nation and restored. LADYANNE'SDIARY: LadyAnneBarnard,daughterofthefifthEarlof Balcarres, was admired for her tough-mindedness and vivacity, in Edinburgh and at the Court of George III. She accompanied her husband to the Cape in 1797 on his appointment by Henry Dundas (later Lord Melville) as secretary to the Governor Lord Macartney. \n￼CONTENTS I KILMARNOCK EDITION AYRSHIRE COAST EARLY DAYS Connections School motto New farm loch Arm's reach Mirror image SPRING WHITE TULIPS TROON REVISITED TERRA FIRMA SUPPER PARTY PEACE AND PLENTY DEPTHS COUNTRY DANCE MAP OF CONINGHAM THE AMERICAN GIRL II JAWBONE WALK INHERITANCE PREVIOUS OCCUPANTS AT THE RESERVOIR THREE AGES OF MAN LOSING TOUCH: Visit Losing touch Ghosts Reiteration Oratorio STRATHCLYDE CONCERTO SAINTE FOY PRESENCE WHITEOUT ABOVE THE STORM \n￼Ill BODY LANGUAGE TE MAORI THE BLUE HOUSE AIR AND WATER IN YOUR DREAMS NORMAN COLLIE AT SLIGACHAN INN UPPER CLYDE First light Voices War memorial Orchard country Contrasts From the air Envoi 1 PAST GLORIES CHOOSING A DRAWING BOUDIN AT THE BURRELL FAUVE GLOBE TROTTER SEARCH LADY ANNE'S DIARY On her arrival In the Cape Insomniac 0O0 \n￼\n￼KILMARNOCK EDITION Not that one but a pictorial volume presented by Kilmarnock Burns Club, won as a prize for recitation, and taken to a supper I was armtwisted into by my English teacher; then erased from my mind, till a quarter of a century later, moving house, my wife, thumbing through it, found a rash of asterisks obscuring To a Mouse and in the margin, directions to accompany that mid-50's rendering: \"Start softly\"; Wee sleekit, cowrin' , timorous beastie... \"Hand on chest\": Oh what a panic's in thy breastie! Then \"pensively\": I'm truly sorry man's dominion... The audience mesmerised no doubt, as I mimed the cruel coulter, gave the daimen icker laldie. But behind self-mockery, I'm conscious of the duality that revels in revealing feet of clay, yet sups up sentimentality, and hope I toed a line mid-way, purveying an underlying genuineness of feeling. In our world of violence, greed and posturing, never greater need for restating his criterion of goodness: whatever mitigates the woes or increases the happiness of others. Declared hand on chest, or otherwise. \n￼AYRSHIRE COAST \"Sandy links and raised beaches... made Ayrshire a prime resort for Victorian and later pleasure-seekers.\" [Ayrshire & Arran/RAIS guide] West Kilbride, Gailes, Barassie, Troon, Prestwick, Bellisle and points between: so the links courses of our schooldays unfold like an apron of green baize brooched by gorse and dune, down Ayrshire's coastline. This year's Masters, watched in comfort by satellite, contrasts with that monochrome age, when first prize in the Daily Mail Tournament (all of £250) went to Dai Rees for \"four sturdy rounds\"; his autograph, alongside Henry Cotton's neat hand, a reminder of what we were desperate to emulate - only to learn in life how rather than the dream parabola adolescence yearns for (golf's equivalent of the perfect iambic pentameter) the ball dips and veers through unsupporting air. Enforced holidays on Troon beach made the most of ice-cream vans enveloped in sea-mist; chittery-bites seized on; female underwear seen surreptitiously, as one-piece swimsuits were discarded - paleness of thigh and breast projecting neither guilt nor embarrassment, which in those days seemed not carnal, or remote, but simultaneously peerless and innocent. A different proposition when we danced a decade later, to Harry Margolyes and his Band, at Ayr's Italianate Pavilion Ballroom; andonthepromonautumn evenings, walking arm in arm, glimpsed through fumbled skeins of blonde or auburn, lighthouses blinking from afar; then to return, our numb cheeks flecked with brine. * \n￼Despite erosion, the coastline scarcely changed. Except, where we believed the breakers would always surge purely, squalor has taken over; successive tides jettisoning scum and debris. You can drive on south toward Heads of Ayr, gaze averted to Arran and its Sleeping Warrior. But hard to stomach, the beaches where we sat unfit for a European health certificate. A history not short on brutalities: where Alexander routed Haakon's invaders - Nardinis wicker-chairs and brash torcheres; unmarked graves, and the occasional stone where fleeing Covenanters were hacked down; while in Dunure's black-vaulted dungeon for the Commendator of Crossraguel's basting, Cassilis \"spared not flaming oil\". Confidently claimed Scotland's microcosm, Arran preserves its own social schism: the hotels in Brodick, Lamlash and Whiting Bay part of a douce but rigid hierarchy; coach-parties welcomed by some, not others; guest-houses girt for the Glasgow Fair when the crowds would mill, and glutted gulls followed the churning of great paddle-wheels. Even in this haven, shades of timor mortis: of the glowing Academy girls we rowed, one succumbing early to sclerosis; others performing the offices, for the Amongst summer's specialties meanwhile persists the democracy of the bicycle; with rucksacked cohorts setting out to the rock-chimney of Glen Sannox, and Goat Fell. * dead. tackle \n￼The Season ending, B&B signs come down; the daily ritual of the sheets ceases; skimpy guest-towels are returned to store. Arcades of fruit-machines empty. Vacated caravan sites reveal their own mal du pays. More grave the varieties of silence, year round, where diverse activities once were: boat-building in harbours madederelict; factorywork-forces hit by the rigours of redundancy. To freewheel down (or up) the Electric Brae an ideal metaphor for the economy; Culzean's castellations, provenance of the rich; and on the skyline, defunct Ailsa Craig, Cuchulain's curling-stone. In a county of milk-yielding heifers, creameries producing ersatz cheeses; lace curtains still gracing Newmilns and Darvel - but their heyday undone by cheap labour from Japan. Pit closures, dignity once attained at the coalface; rails rusting from Doon to Dalmellington: Cockburn's \"last place in Ayrshire where with a good deal of primitive manufacture, rural simplicity and contentment linger\" - its Age of Iron having come and gone... Whisky aside, the one sacrosanct industry centres on Alloway. Burns statues scan a World which while paying lip-service, reveals less and less his philosophy of brotherhood, than Man's inhumanity to Man. \n￼EARLY DAYS Connections Changing trains at Glasgow Central, en route for a poetry workshop in Kilmarnock, I visit the bookstall which has, needless to say, none of my volumes on display. Nor any sign on the departures board of my connection, I'msoearly. Eventuallyitappears: objective reality restored, at least. Soon the old litany: Dunlop, Stewarton, Kilmaurs... As my fellow-travellers, secure in their identities or otherwise, journey on towards Sanquhar, Carlisle, my reception counters expectation: a strummed guitar; the car in a tarmacked space where rails once were, set in cobbles, to ease the dray-horses' burden. To an unaccustomed music, and hyacinths in bloom, the decades dissolve, and we coast into town. School motto Among my memories: a smell of modelling clay (this before coloured plasticine); rows of Mickey Mouse gas-masks (placing me in the early 40's); and school caps, regularly floating like rowan berries down the Kilmarnock water. Our infants mistress, Annie C. MacLarty, FEIS, took us to her ample bosom \n￼before handing us over to Davy Gordon, who ruled with a rod of iron. In senior school we were further matured by two breakdowns and a suicide. Later our French master went into mourning, when a colleague's son got only a third at Aberdeen. By then, we others had gone our own way: unshriven, but trying (some of us) to do justly, love mercy, and walk humbly... New Farm Loch We skated here after school, breath visible in the frosty air, chestnuts sizzling, the ice ringing. Or played football, blazers for goals; Tom Campbell ghosting down the wing; others less skilled, picked as a cock or a hen. Drained long since, the loch's declivity holds a housing estate. Yet I sense presences blowing on their fingers as if all these years later, my schooldays were pursuing me through acres of trees \n￼no longer there. The one tangiblereminder: ahole in my left knee, where the heel of a skate sank in. Arm's reach Of moments treasured: having scaled the tree, ripe pears gathered unbruised. Some peeled and preserved in syrup. The remainder each year, painstakingly stored in paper and straw. The tubbed windfall, mush for wasps. These days, even could I climb to the top, I'd most likely find the branch and its fruit just out of arm's reach. Mirror image Evening drawing in, I revisit old haunts: the Burns monument, smaller than I recall; St Marnock's, its trees squat as ever; and facing the Dick Institute the sandstone Academy, dominant on its hill. Over a couple of pints in the Goldberry I'm told I don't sound like I'm really from Killie; the intervening years having added an overlay. But things seem togosmoothly. Sothatbythetime I'm back at the station, I'm confident I could pass for local. Till reflected in the waiting-room window, I see a familiar figure carrying a plastic bag emblazoned, \"Ayrshire and the Burns country\" \n￼SPRING Ayrshire is breaking into leaf, you say, then convey in detail sound and scenery, fresh limes emerging, a grasshopper warbler's whirringsong. ItmakesmethinkofDaphne fleeing Apollo, and her father's answer to her prayer: leaves sprouting from her hair and hands, bark shielding her quivering body. The one a timely metaphor for the other: the dew, escaping its lover's ardour, leaving nothing but verdure, where a moment earlier, it sparkled purely. You'll be telling me next how lovers lie languid under every laurel tree; Aurora filling the air from Girvan to Dunure; Arran's outline clear, across a wine-dark sea. t \n￼WHITE TULIPS Over the years, now decades, memories sporadically surface for no seeming reason: among them one of a classmate's sister who, playing one day at the Creamery, must have tripped and fallen in. I still shudder involuntarily, at the pain encountered, the scalding of her skin; and can but pray her engulfing was mercifully speedy. As I sit in the garden this fragrant May afternoon she comes to mind, incongruous light-years away. First there's the shiver that coursed through us, who at that age thought ourselves scatheless. Only after this, do I consciously take in these tulips beside me, their ghostly whiteness grown suddenly diaphonous in the light breeze. \n￼TROON REVISITED Never a swimmer, my dominant memory of Troon beach is of a toe half-severed by broken glass, the painful hirple to the house. At this remove even, I tread gingerly. Constants: the spire of St. Meddan's, Marr's copper dome; tankers that seem moored since last time. Less propitious: peeling frontages, grimy dunes netted against erosion, engendering insecurity, gentility going to seed. Sensing an epoch gone, I recall the zigzag from tee to green when in our heyday we tackled Fullarton, then cycled to savour Togs's famed ice-cream. Concession too, of disillusion within a personal littoral. The harbour shrunken, the Ballast Bank less precipitous - accomplices to further self-perception: as with a mountain cairn, its attainment once a measure of achievement, found to be no more than knee-high, Lilliputian. The town itself, once \"one of Ayrshire's leading ports\", reverting more and more to how we saw it: breaking-up yard for the elderly, where the retired sit under glass, among potted geraniums, the air growing acrid as they doze or drily scrutinise their stocks and shares. Along the front, those solid Victorian villas, double-glazed which in our day were heavy-curtained, but still draughty; and in a crescent below the station, behind blowsy roses and laden trellises, the curvaciously bow-windowed bungalow/ we as schoolboys nicknamed Marilyn Monroe. Countering this, the mock 15th century rigour of Our Lady of the Assumption, in the shadow of whose buttressed tower worshippers briefly shiver. I look up, to see the crocketed finery of its timber spire - and far beyond, against an azure sky, white jet-trails crossing, a perfect saltire. \n￼TERRA FIRMA The church of which my father was minister lowered over my boyhood, its front elevation imprinted on the retina; an endowed carillon spendthrift expenditure of a sum more practical if put towards the maintenance of rotting roof timbers and friable sandstone. Although latterly dwarfed by the Police Station and Sheriff Court opposite, an architectural survey recently lauded its structure from hood-moulded main door to battlemented tower, not to mention the pulpit's fine expression of the crescendo of the Gothic revival... We'd never have guessed (far less cared) when as children we fidgeted on hard pews, that those encompassing walls in future years would be praised as scholarly perpendicular - a paradox sharpened by the then snobbery of the town's more class-conscious clergy one of whom murmured, after his ordination, \"Of course St Marnock's isn't on the map, Conn\". Throughout his calling, in ways I was then too young to comprehend, he remained his own man: voicing concern for single mothers, whom the Kirk's committees saw as \"fallen women\"; and believing an unfashionable ecumenicalism the way to enlightenment, debating at Coodham and courting the Kilmarnock Standard's abuse by counting among his friends, RC priests. As through a glass darkly, I have come to a more comprehending admiration for the industry and integrity he must have channelled into his ministry - rather than any inheriting of beliefs: partly because he never exerted pressure but permitted me to go my own way, doubtless praying it would not be to purgatory. \n￼Those moments uppermost, at a lifetime's remove, of austere ritual, redeemed by love under the lights of the Christmas tree; and at harvest festivals, ripe sheaves round the walls of the shadowy vestibule, fruit heaped before the communion-table, then the delivery of flowers and vegetables by the Bible Class: a child's view of the tangible manifestations of others' belief in Divinity, not the tenets sustaining it. Today the building stands, like a preserved dragon - forbidding still, but no longer breathing flame.
