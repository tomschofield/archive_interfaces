They don\u2019t play Shakespeare properly - not the way We used to. Too superior For a frontcloth, that\u2019s their Trouble. Opera use it, why not Theatre? I mean, take the first scene from Caesar - That ought to be done out front, the main Area set for the procession. As for Hamlet, a gravedigger here Or there hardly matters any more. (I saw Benson, as the Prince, Carried off after \u2018The rest is silence\u2019 - But that improved the text.) Donat, Martin-Harvey... what style. Another thing, We\u2019d always an orchestra in the pit For the Bard - not a gramophone in the wings. Stage effects too: real waterfalls, You name it - even Skegness, Still the gas-floats. All they want these Days in a lad is, well you know ...balls. Not that I\u2019m against manliness, Anything of the sort. Bawdry, for that matter. I just think there are other Things that count, besides filling a codpiece. 24 \n￼Birds of Passage {-{frn Gevtge Aiiid'iiy i)rvivrt)f Whv do we keep coming back, year After year, who do not belong here? To this rock, where black rabbits abound? The soil is poor, the lighthouse unmanned. There is nothing of birth, or/ftrocessioi^X. Nor is it entirely the broch, with its sparse Sward and saint\u2019s bones. Yet something stronger Than mere habit (so unquestioned, When the time comes) draws us to where We can see the turnstone swoop, and hear The mallard massing in the air. 4 / jP crS-eiti&-<v, \n￼£migree A young girl in a faded photograph, You sit delicately holding a fur muff: Wistful yet wary, as though you already know What winters await you, what habitual snow; What unheated rooms and visits to the dacha (Funeral bells tolling), what journeys on the Volga In late spring, the pack-ice melting.jj ^ ^ ( I imagine you trying out your halting English on the servants; starting at a frown On a familiar face, an icon staring down. You are to escape all this, leaving behind The women in black, the massive chambers With their velvet curtains, the great chandeliers - And outside, cannon firing along the frontiers OfEurope. How you have changed over the years.jj But I realise that what you have retained Is a stunning sharpness of eye and mind. Seeing through our masculine conjuring-tricks A lesser concern,-your ear is attuned To the distant whistling of a more brutal axe. x 26 ( f % \n￼Journeying North Leaving Carlisle, the diesel pulls Uphill, till a signal falls And we put on speed. That morning I\u2019d seen the Magritte exhibition At the Tate. One portrait, O f a couple kissing through sacking, Put me in mind of Darnley In his taffeta mask, then of our Fumbling devotion. Out there, The slack reaches of Solway. Another, more sinister, Had two Edwardian Figures With a club and a net; A nude on a bed, Her mouth pouring blood. Hurtling north, my fears Are of a different order: Imagining you laying my meal On a frail cloth that might Have been a bridal veil, 1consider the split cell, The unruly corpuscle In the gallery7of the skull... The air thick with tobacco-smoke We near Gretna. Heavy anvils strike. \n! North Uist (forJohn Purser) 1 My new waders are like far-off dogs, whining. My shoulder-strap could be a wheatear Turning a corner. The wind, through the cleat O f my landing-net, makes the squeaking Of many mice busying themselves under cover. On his ledge overlooking the loch The buzzard that is too big for a buzzard Eyes everything stonily, then takes his pick. 2 Uist, a smashed mirror. I holiday here, To gather strength for the winter. So I fire my peats, gut Trout, rub cold hands together: Reassured that when December Does come, I shall be far From here. Like all city dwellers. 3 Solas I try to locate a tiny ratchet At my right ear, an insomniac Cheese-grater somewhere beyond my toes. The place is hoaching with mice. They are in For the winter. Every so often We have an eyeball to eyeball confrontation. One way to dispose of them is to fire The thatch. A costly operation. 4 Sgurr an Duin Three days I have trudged After a pair of eagles; sighting them Occasionally, overhead or on fence-stakes, ￼30 \n￼Surveying their land. This evening, Probing gobbets of fur, disgorged bone, I am perceived by a deer who stands sniffing, Then bounds over the wire, And effortlessly away.ill 5 Striding back from the Co-op, I clutch My sodden groceries in a plastic bag One handle of which is sprung. Proud of the buffeting I\u2019m taking, I feel I belong: Till I meet a chained mongrel, Yap-yapping; and an old woman Who slurches past, head down. 6 Vallay Strand The sky consists of strips O f blue, like a holiday postcard. I sit writing, like a man writing A holiday postcard. The strips Turn to steel, to smoky grey. The tide recedes, and recedes, All the way to Vallay. Meanwhile, The multitudinous sandworms turn and turn. 7/ItvAge \u2022j If, as the pundits say, A new Ice Age does Come, well I suppose Uist Will be as ready as most. The skuas sharp as razors; The lochans, crystal. And in the long chambers, T he War Lords are sleeping still. ■Xt J ^7 j <\// / - f x \u2022 \n￼Three Circus Poems Lion-Tamer InJ^thThoTbreath, the ring round me O f haunch and mane, the eye always on me. Strop of muscular shoulder, the easy Stride, tail switching the sawdust up. The jaws foremost in my mind - which take Flesh, drip flame: could at no notice A man\u2019s sinews snap, like a clown Draw me tattered through a paper hoop. Not skill, but knowledge. O f the fiery Bowl, the fierce flower that\u2019s lion. Attention caught. The soft paw. Giant Cat. Who\u2019s met, who\u2019s held, who\u2019s master. The one danger (and lion can sense it) That the mind slip from its ring To where the crowd sits, tier upon tier, Its breath fetid, hungering for the killing. Clown j ^eelc'in', week out, over half England. Folk Laughing their ruddy heads off. My world A paper hoop, coloured balls, a plastic Smile. Beginning to get past it, though. Mean to say, it knocks me out. You try Being up a ladder one minute, the next flat On your face. Fancy a turn on the stilts? Or having cold water squirted up your pants? Okay for the seven-and-sixes. But how About me? My eyes itching, gut stuck With straw, sweat in my armpits pricking. What you could call scratching a living. Had a couple of goes at the telly: interviewed, And that. Ruined my chances, ask me. \u2018This bloke you\u2019re always on about\u2019 I said, \u2018This bloke Hamlet \u2014who the ruddy hell\u2019s he?\u2019 32 \n￼Elephant-Girl /?alaniceqrtrying to tell you, just An ordinary girl. This maharanee Stuff, that\u2019s strictly for the show... Yes, Shettleston, my mum tells me. I'he usual tastes, what do you mean? The leather gear\u2019s for the act, see. That\u2019s right, the boots too. Look Ducky, there\u2019s nothing kinky about me. The circus? No choice. Born into it, Like 1 said. In the blood. Talk And breathe elephants. Sat On their backs before I could walk.. That\u2019s right, develops the muscles. Could be dangerous, I suppose. Never think About it. Elephants is like people, you see. Okay, so long as you can take the stink / /v\\^ / 33 \n￼The Chinese Tower I i lard land and dry, yet already The lavendcr-clumps arc bristling Like hassocks for Provencal ladies. Crickets cross and uncross their legs. The pine-slopes are musty. Soon The valley will turn as on a spit. In this world of bells, of goats Heavily thonged, of thyme tracking The tree-line, so single-minded Do the senses become that for them The only escape is trussed brutally To the bellies of great beasts. II But under rain, the land Is tin. There is brimstone Among the mountains. Watertroughs overflow Like basins of wine. Lightning fills the street. Then two men with umbrellas And between them Fifty sheepy whose bells Are the din of a drowned City. Now they are gone. The crickets, too, are silent. 38 \n￼ill In as never before such blueness (Though to them the merest Translation of summer) two huntsmen Traverse the valley. 'They tack As one, as yachts evenly paced; Though here in no breeze, but welter O f blueness. Even time can be treated In terms of colour: nor arises Matter of identity. The cricket\u2019s Disguise, the butterfly fired From slate - these are proof, Not part, of the same. You doubt it? Watch then\u201dthose huntsmen Scouring that hill. Watch them 1lalt, as one. Watch an arm Rise, and fall. And wait, The length of the valley away, For the sound of rushing stone. IV Or I find you, in a straw hat, Chasing butterflies. Even thefi Stress the one-ness of it all,/ Whose every movement is irretrievable Yet infinitely repeated. Such Is the truth not of this place only But of things - hence of things In this place. A bluetail shimmers Ki a specific, no mere casual sun. / \n￼V The waters of a mountain stream Assume the shape of ravine, then Create ravines of their own In air. This in accordance With the natural freedom O f things. And the village pump Always runs, a silver thread. Ravine and rich chasm in one, Its surface is a source of light. VI In a wilderness that is No wilderness hut a pasture Among pines, the shepherd Has built his cabin. Between The sources of light and water. There is much philosophy in this. His pack always holds Hypodermics against viper-bite. For the sheep, not himself. For himself there is a stick. Nor does he waste time deducing What is there clearly to be seen. 40 \n￼At a given moment, there may Be no scent, no sign O f fox: no instant indication. Thus the jays go cackling From thicket to thicket, consumed With pride. Yet remains Always presence of fox. The air where he has been Holds his shape.., VIII High among-pines, on a hill Overlooking the chapel, is a Chinese Tower. Both in name, and style. Behind it a viper lies coiled. Is he lord of this place? Has he an enquiring mind? But the pines change from green To smoky blue. Already there is A chill in the air. Questions Need no answer. In absence, The presence of snake grows Strangely stronger. This square O f stone: an outlook tower. Yet from few places can it be seen. Certainly from nowhere in the village. \n￼IX O f the tower three things Are commonly said. That At its base is a well O f pure water (this being Open to proof)- That formerly A tunnel led underground To the village (this To be taken on trust). And thirdly that once, In time of fire, monks Went dripping like candle-wax Down the face of the rock. X From the Chinese tower can be seen The swerve of the valley, the lavender Fields and the mountains, pink Beyond. With finger in air You can trace the tracks O f ravines, mark the pantiled Roofs of houses, of lofts, of the church That strikes every hour twice. And slowly, the blueness becomes Penetrable. There must always Be just such a place - its Tiny bells chinking in the wind. |Thorame, Provence] 42 \n￼Tremors We took turns at laying An ear on the rail - So that we could tell By the vibrations When a train was coming. Then we\u2019d flatten ourselves To the banks, scorched Vetch and hedge-parsley, While the iron flanks Rushed past, sending sparks Flying. It is more and more A question of living With an ear to the ground: The tremors, when they come, Are that much greater - For ourselves, and others. Nor is it any longer A game, but a matter O f survival: each explosion Part of a procession There can be no stopping. Though the end is known, There is nothing for it But to keep listening,Jj \n￼A Sense of Order Sunday Walk / t^stOfTaftfTe foot of Garioch Drive Where my aunt used to live Three floors up.I remember the smell Of camomile that hit you in the hall, The embroidered sampler, the jars O f wax chrysanths, the budgerigars In their lacquered cage; the ladies who came To read the Bible in the front room - Surrounded by marzipan, and dragons On silky screens.A rag-and-bone man, His pony ready for the knacker\u2019s yard, Rounds a comer (short of a tail-light) And disappears up Clouston Street. Below, the Kelvin runs like stinking lard. PeriodPiece TfehcfInTumd, the girls glide Along Great Western Road.Outside The Silver Slipper the boys wait, Trousers flared, jacket-pockets Bulging with carry-outs. The girls approach.

I have not been back, for years. The brass nameplate, the square Bellpull, mean nothing any more. What is there to recapture, To rediscover? It is too late in the season, for that.
