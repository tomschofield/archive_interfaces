I wish you nothing but good. I think you are not of ordinary parentage. Your face is delightful to look at and Like that of a queen and law-giver Inclines us to reverence. We who are not gods Must submit to what they send although it be A yoke of sorrow. Since you have come to us I will give you what I can. Will you nurse my son Whom the gods have given me now late in my life After much prayer and when I had stopped hoping? If you will bring him to the start of manhood When your work is done I will reward you with such gifts That you will be envied among the women.\u2019 Demeter, Haloed with shining hair, said \u2018Lady Blessings upon you likewise, and may the gods Endow you with good. I will be, as you ask, Your baby\u2019s nurse and bring him up, nor shall, Through carelessness of mine, any ill come near him Nor will he suffer pains, for against ill-wishing And to ward off pain I have a wealth of knowledge.\u2019 Then Metaneira was happy and handed her son to The goddess, who hugged him close. So he, Demophoon, child of Celeus, a good man, And Metaneira, the loving, was nursed in the palace A mother\u2019s milk, for by day shining Demeter Smeared his body with ambrosia as though he were Her own son and a god and breathed upon him Sweetly as she hugged him close. But at nights unbeknown to His loving parents she would lay him like a coal in The secret heart of the fire. They saw with wonder Their child growing beyond his years and becoming For them, mortal, like a god to look at. She would Have given him eternal youth and eternal life Had not Metaneira, the careful mother, wrongly One night, anxious to see, come down. She saw And clutched her two hands upon her heart And screamed in fear for her beloved son and cried Beside herself: \u2018My child, Demophoon, the stranger 78 And cjreyo like a.r\\ lonmortjil nest ed tAjdh bod nor \n￼0 Is burying you in the heart of the fire, alas She has done us a terrible harm.\u2019 Demeter, Brighter to look at than a white fire, heard The ashen woman moaning and that dear child, The late-comer, the mother\u2019s no longer hoped for, She snatched with her unconsuming hands from the / And threw him from her down on the ground in terrible Anger, crying: \u2018Humanity, what fools you are Without foreknowledge of the good or the evil Coming your way. O human mother, the folly You have done will never be undone. I swear By Styx, by the pitiless waters, and give you my word I should have made him deathless, your dear son, Nor would he have aged and the honour I gave him Would have been everlasting. But now he will not elude By any means Death and the Fates. Only this, that he Once lay upon my knees and slept in my arms Will be his glory and cannot be undone. In time However, in his beautiful manhood, the sons Of Eleusis will go to war with one another Delete) e / And there will always be discord. I am Denver Honoured by gods and men as bringer to both d.rmy Of help and joy. But now let all your people Build me a great temple and an altar below it Below the city and its sheer wall, above Callichorus Upon a rising hill. I will teach you my worship So that afterwards piously doing as I say You may incline me to kindness.\u2019 Then Demeter - Changed her stature and her appearance, put off Old age, the air about her shone With beauty, streamed with the scent of her clothes, Her body was a bright light and her hair Tumbled down shining upon her shoulders. The house Filled with a brightness like that of lightning. So she left them. Metaneira could barely stand. She remained for a long time dumb, forgetting Even to take up her baby, her lastborn, Who lay on the floor. He cried and cried until He woke his sleeping sisters. They came running And one took him up in her aifyijs and hugged him close, \n￼Another mended the fire, another hastened Quietly to bring the mother away. Then all Crowding together they bathed.the kicking child And cuddled him. But he would not be comforted Because these nurses and maids holding him now Were not the goddess. All night they never left off Praying to be back in her good graces again, All night shaking with fear. But when the morning came They told the whole story to the ruler Celeus As Demeter, haloed with a blinding beauty, Had said they must. Their father assembled the people And said they must build a temple to Demeter And an altar, on the hillock. And they obeyed And built it, for the goddess. And when they had done Labouring and building the men went home again Each to his family. But Demeter, the corn-golden, Sat alone in the home they had built her Still shunning the company of all the blessed gods Thin in the face for grief over Persephone Her child. And on the earth that nurtures us all She inflicted such a year as we shall never forget, A hungry year. The seed would not sprout in the ground For grieving Demeter shut it. The oxen ploughed The fields for nothing and the white barley in handfuls Fell on the land like pebbles. She would have starved The human race to death and the Olympians Would have gone short of the tithes and sacrifices Which they exact from men, had not Zeus, the canny, Turning the matter over, sent Iris, winged With golden light, to fetch Demeter, whose beauty They were missing. Iris obeyed black Zeus And flew quicker than rainshafts through the air And coming to the fragrant city of Eleusis Found Demeter alone in her temple wrapped in black And said: \u2018Lord God Almighty Zeus, absolute In wisdom, wants you back, Demeter, where you, Goddess, belong, among the immortals, so come Do as he wishes.\u2019 80 \n￼Iris begged her. But she, Grief-stricken, would not obey. Then Zeus, The eternal happiness in Heaven being troubled, Sent down to her one after the other All the gods, and they came in turn, calling her name And bringing beautiful gifts and offering whatever Favours in Heaven she cared to choose. But northing Moved her, and nobody, so deep-rooted now Was her bitterness. She closed her ears to their bribes And swore she would never set foot again on Olympus, Their scented heaven, and never release the seed From prison in the ground, until she saw her child Pt;dsephone, the bright-eyed. Zeus, big noise, Know-all, when he heard this despatched The Killer of Argus and Bearer of the Golden Rod To Hell, with suitable blarney there to softsoap Brother Death and lead the chaste Persephone Out of the dark, through the mists, into the light, Into the company of the gods again, that Demeter, Seeing her, would relent. Hermes obliged, and leaving The House of Heaven betook himself rapidly to the places That are below the earth. He found King Death At home in his halls, seated on a couch and by him The girl, ashamed, hating his company and pining To be with her mother (who, far off, was Spoiling The quiet lives of the gods). The Killer of Argus, The unafraid Hermes, stood very close to Death And said: \u2018Hades, Black Lord of the Dead, I am ordey(by Zeus to bring Persephone From Erebus, back among the gods so that Her mother, seeing her, may cease being angry And cease injuring us. She intends nothing less Than the destruction of earth\u2019s humanity by imprisoning The seed in the soil, and when they die, and that Will not be long, where shall we unhappy gods Get worship from? Her anger is terrible, she will not Come near us but sits alone in in her temple In Eleusis among the rocks.\u2019 Thus Hermes. Unsmiling Hades, King of Ghosts, smiled blackly \n￼' r-s. 'jv'i And bowed to Zeus, the stronger, and said: \u2018Persephone, go at once now home to your mother, The goddess in mourning, and towards myself, if you can, Be kinder, please, and do not think what has happened The worst possible thing. You could do plenty worse For a husband among the gods than me, brother As I am of His Majesty. Down here Yd will be queen of everything that has Its being after the fashion of the dead and among The gods none\u2019s status will be greater and whoever Gives you less than your due and does not with offerings Strive officiously for your favour and performs Less than satisfactorily in your worship or Falls behind in the payment of contributions he Or she will writhe in Hell for ever.\u2019 Persephone, The toting, leapt to her feet full of joy To be leaving Death but he, kissing her Goodbye, slipped slyly from mouth to mouth The juicy seed of a pomegranate so that She swallowed it and was thwarted in her wish Always to stay with her mother, revered Demeter Cloafked in midnight blue. Aidoneus, Ruler of Many, Receiver of More and More, Made a great show of harnessing his horses, Undying among the dead, to the golden chariot and handed his captive in. The Killer of A^gus Took up the reins and the whip and left the halls O f Hell at a gallop. The enormous distances Were put behind them in no time and over salt And rivers of freshwater and lowland grass And high crags they passed like a parting spear Through the deep air. Hermes, the coachman, Reined the horses in, outside the scented temple, The hiding-place of Queen Demeter. Like one of The mad women of Dionysos when the/career Down mountainsides so Demeter when she saw Persephone ran to her and she, the child, Seeing her mother\u2019s face, the lovely, the beloved, trosboQ) (U (S\u2019J( 82 \n￼Jumped from the chriot, left the standing horses, And ran and fell upon her mother\u2019s neck Tight-hugging her. Demeter though, whilst yet Holding her child again, felt suddenly cold In the heart and her hands ceased caressing Persephone. She cried: \u2018Oh, child, you did not, did you, Tell me, taste any food underground? Say not Or tell me the worst. For if you tasted nothing Then you have seen the last of ugly Hades Then you will live in the house of God your father, Storm-brewer Zeus, the Castrator\u2019s son, And me, honoured among the gods, but if Down there you swallowed something you must Go back into the lifeless places for one Third part of every year\u2019s seasons And stay with me for two. When with flowers In spring, with the innumerable sweet flowers, The earth revives, then you will surface again Out of the dark, out of the mists, your coming will be Wonderful to the gods in Heaven who see Of springtimes an eternity and to men on earth Who see a handful. But tell me, child, How he took you into the dark who is the strong Receiver of More and More, by what crooked means Did he add you?\u2019 The girl Persephone, The radiant child, answered her mother thus: \u2018When lucky Hermes, the hurrying messenger, came On the part of my father, the Son of Kronos, and the others In Heaven, to fetch me from Erebus, that you Might have me back again and relent in your anger And hard grudge against the gods, I jumped For joy. But Death, with a kiss, slyly Planted in me the seed of a pomegranate, Sweet to taste, and this I had to swallow Though I did not want to. And as to how He took me in the first place with the connivance O f my own father, the Usurper Zeus, and carried me to That world below the roots, I will tell you exactly: We were playing together in a lovely meadow, I And the daughters of Ocean\u2014these: Leucippe, \n￼Phaeno, Electra, Ianthe, Melita, Iache, Rhodea and Callirhoe, Melobosis, Tyche and Ocyrhoe who is Herself flowerlike, and Chryseis and Ianeira, Acaste, Admete, Rhodope and Pluto, Sweet Calypso, Urania and beautiful Galaxaura. We were playing and picking Armfuls of lovely flowers, such as Irises and hyacinths, roses and/^re Lilies than I have ever seen, but I Loved most of all a certain narcissus, Crocus-yellow at the centre, and when I reached for this the earth, the broad earth Full of flowers, gave and from that hole The Lord who has Dominion over Millions, Gold-chariot-driving, rose and took me Under the earth into the dark, resistant, Vanishing, screaming. Mother, he sleeps and wakes Where the dead are, their only light Is like the pallor of tubers, he never smiles, They never see the sun, and the worst is That I have eaten what he gave me.\u2019 But all day then Mother and daughter had an equal gladness. They lessened for one another with embraces The grief in their hearts, the loathing in their minds. It was an equal giving and receiving O f presents of happiness. Then Hecate, Coiffed with the sickle moon, came near. She also Hugged close the precious daughter of Demeter And was her attendant and companion thereafter. Thunderous God sent another messenger, His mother Rhea of the Lovely Hair, to beg Her daughter Demeter, cloaked in black, to join The happy family of the gods again. This doing, He promised, she would be given such honours In Heaven as she thought fit. Her child, alas, Must spend a third part of the revolving year BeloW, in blackness, but the rest with her 84 ","docTitle":"","docDate":"2014-07-01 09:48:03.590"},"meta":{"contentType":"text/raw","emVer":"7.1.1103.5","langIdVer":"DefaultLangId","processingVer":"CalaisJob01","submissionDate":"2014-07-01 09:47:59.227","submitterCode":"57b17a53-6e34-87b0-20ff-a419896f49c9","signature":"digestalg-1|OBmsKdQyMVW4fb6C37UL6x3zx+E=|F/6Fv2uCNltaMJ3jT8Lil9Z0xhaJASqj7yx+gQYZlxbPAR1RbMa/lA==","language":"English"}},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/0fa2cf67-a5e5-37b4-8c06-e6793d211db4/cat/1":{"_typeGroup":"topics","category":"http://d.opencalais.com/cat/Calais/HumanInterest","classifierName":"Calais","categoryName":"Human Interest","score":0.596},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/0fa2cf67-a5e5-37b4-8c06-e6793d211db4/lid/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http://d.opencalais.com/lid/DefaultLangId/English"},"http://d.opencalais.com/pershash-1/22b840cb-18c8-35d9-b6d0-bac167d19492":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"Person","name":"How","persontype":"N/A","nationality":"N/A","commonname":"How","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/Person","instances":[{"detection":"[on earth Who see a handful.
