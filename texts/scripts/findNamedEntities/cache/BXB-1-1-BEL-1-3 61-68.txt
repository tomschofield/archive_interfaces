Beside her, the Virgin is small - Fragile distaff, waiting for Angelus - And St Joseph, upstaged, in his niche Shoves his candle at us. It\u2019s H er Pardon - fun and gam es and Mystery - the stubble\u2019s hopping with fleas - Anne, Sainted Ointment, cure-all For mothers-in-law, and husband\u2019s ease. From the parishes round about, From Plougastel and Loc-Trudy, They\u2019ve arrived already, camping out Three nights, three days, up till Monday. Three days, three nights, the salt-marsh blares With music - the rite\u2019s traditional - Heavenly choir and singing drunks - Beginneth the SACRED CANTICLE. II 0 M other, carved out with a chopper From oak heart, hard and good, Your gold robe hides a solid Breton Soul, all one piece, honest wood. \n￼l 62 Green crone with a used-up face, Boulder under the flood, Fretted by tears o f love, Parched by tears o f blood. You, whose shrivelled breasts Were plumped again, to carry A purposeful virginity - The Virgin Mary. Proud housekeeper, mistress and servant, Related to the Almighty, The poor are pleased to talk to you For you answer them politely. A wand for the blind, and crutches For cripples, arms for the new-born, A mother for Madame your Daughter - You\u2019ve adopted all the forlorn. Blossom of new maidenhead! Fruit o f wife\u2019s swollen udder! Garden of rest for the widow! District Nurse for the widower! Joachim\u2019s Arch! O Ancestress! Four-leaf clover! Misdetoe bough! Medallion with a rubbed-out face! Horeb! Jesse\u2019s Rod! Our way! You kept the Fire in And went on with your knitting As darkness came down round your lap Where the Child was sitting. You were there, the one who could cope, Making garments in Bethlehem, Still there, stitching the shroud, Grief-stunned in Jerusalem. I 1 1 \n￼Your face is a wrinkled map O f crosses - your hair white as linen \u2014 Keep from pedantic evil eyes T h e cots o f our grandchildren. The born, the not-yet born, Bring on, and keep them well, And smuggle water from your tears When God isn\u2019t looking, to Hell. Take back little children In white nightgowns, fading away, And summon the old who are bored T o the everlasting Sunday. O growl! The Virgin\u2019s Dragon! Keep the crib safe and secure, And keep bitching at Joseph T o sweep round the front door. Pity the girl in the family way And the small boy lost on the road - If anyone throws a stone Change it into bread. Beacon on sea and on land, Harbour, stars over heath, Good Lady, through tempest, through You beckon towards a good death. Humble; no star at your feet - Humble and strong to save - Your veil in the clouds means peril, Pale halo over the wave. Those whose lives are a mess - Begging pardon - sunk in the booze Show them the steeple and clock, The road back to the house. \n￼63 64 Fire the Christians hereabouts With your own zeal, gentle and chaste, And gather your simples, Wise Woman, To soothe the homed beast. Be an example to housewives O f work and fecundity - And say hullo to our relations Already in eternity. We\u2019ll line up an army of candles - Spermaceti - the best - all the way Round your chapel. We\u2019ll celebrate Low mass at the break of day. Keep our hearths safe From spells and folk who are spiteful... We\u2019ll give you at Easter Flax, a whole distaff-full. If our bodies stink on earth Your grace is a bath for our good: Shower on us in this graveyard Your wholesome odour of sainthood. Till next year, then. Here\u2019s your candle, (Three half-crowns it\u2019s cost me). Respects to Madame the Virgin, Not forgetting the Holy Trinity. Ill And the faithful, in penitent nightshirts, - St Anne, have pity, please - Drag themselves round the church Three times, on their knees. And go on to drink the waters, Miraculous now, from the hole Where scabby Jobs have bathed... Your faith has made you whole. \n￼Down there they hold their suppers, The wretched, Jesus\u2019s brethren, And you won\u2019t see any miracles, But real holes: Put your finger in ... On their hurdles they look like saints, With scarlet nimbuses, each one An owner of extensive sores Like rubies glinting in the sun. A barking man with rickets Just can\u2019t stop his arm-stump\u2019s twitch - Can\u2019t help elbowing the epileptic Having a fit in the same ditch. By a tree-trunk, misdetoe-bitten, Stands a man with an ulcer that bites - And a mother and daughter are dancing Choreography by St Vitus. A father heats up a poultice For a small son who\u2019s not thriving: A boy owes a lot to his father - The chancre earns their living. There\u2019s an idiot since he was born, An angel-blasted simpleton, Ecstatic in his innocence - The simple are close to heaven. Watch, passer-by, all passes...but The idiot\u2019s stare is stone and firm - He must be in a state of grace, For grace is outside time. Among the crowd after evensong, When the holy water\u2019s sprayed us, A corpse sticks out, alive, a long Leper... relic of the crusaders. \n￼65 66 Then those who the kings of France Used to cure with a touch - Since France has cut off her kings, Their God\u2019s cut his mercy by that much. Put something into their bowls - All our forefathers carried it, The Fleur-de-Lys of King\u2019s Evil Which these are chosen to inherit. Miserere then for the junketings Of these dirty old outcast Bretons... But stumps can be managed like pincers And crutches are weapons. Venture among them, able-bodied, But take care to keep your fleece on - Beware o f Fingers that hook, o f legs Fixed in Kyrie Eleison. And if you\u2019d be sight-seeing, dear, Take a look and turn back quick - From under these scraps o f rags A scrap o f flesh might prick. They\u2019re hunting on their own estates With Arms emblazoned on their skins! Their hands have the droit de seigneur Over anything clutched therein. Offerings heaped - of rotting meat - Heaven\u2019s elect - with death-house features - They make themselves at home with God For surely they\u2019re his creatures. They\u2019re swarming in the churchyard - As if the dead mistook the Day OfJudgement, crawling out from stones That crush the limbs they drag away. \n￼We\u2019ve no right to talk - they\u2019re sacred. It\u2019s Adam\u2019s sin they\u2019re punished for. The Almighty\u2019s Finger has marked them, The Almighty\u2019s right be praised therefore! The scapegoats of the bellowing flock, Loaded with every sin we\u2019re at, God works his anger off on them! The vicar of St Anne\u2019s is fat. IV But a palpitating note, A gasping echo in the breeze, Cuts across the grumbling drone O f this walking purgatory. Keening like a beast in pain, She stands beside the Calvary, H alf a blind beggar, as it were, No dog and only one eye. - A weather-bitten ballad-singer, Drop a halfpenny in her hat And she\u2019ll do you Abaylar, Wandering Jew, Or any other old favourite. O but her song is long-drawn-out, Complaining like a thing ill-used, Like a long day with nothing to eat, So lamentable her blues. She sings just as she breathes, a bird Without a nest, with no Fine feathers, Battering blindly as she flies Round granite God, in granite weather. She can talk, too, if that matters, As far as she can see she thinks - The main road keeps stretching before her If she gets hold of sixpence, she drinks. \n￼67 68 A woman, oh dear yes - her skirt Is strings held together by string: Black teeth grip an empty pipe - Life is full of excellent things! Her name? Call her Misery. Got herself bom, somehow, somewhere - Somewhere, someday will be found dead - There\u2019ll be no fuss, no one will care. If you come across her, poet, Humping her army kit-bag - Please recognise our sister, Give her a few fills of shag. You\u2019ll see on her furrowed face A smile crack right across Like splitting wood, her scaly hand Make a genuine sign of the cross.
