The myths are bloody. In this wet crack For Mother Rhea, weary of fruitless birth, the Kouretes Hid God the usurper, little Zeus, from the cunning, The child-swallowing pronos\u2014himselfa son who for his mother, Gaia, the Earthfweary of copulation, reaped from his father, Vast Ouranos,'tne parts necessary with a jagged sickle. The cry a hurt sky makes echoes for ever. His fading semen splashed Heaven. Seaborn O f the rosy froth where the unspeakable fell, our fierce And gentle need grew. Blow out the candle. Darker Than this and unimaginably deeper is Tartarus where grown Zeus confined outwitted wily Kronos, having exhumed Vigorous brothers and sisters from his guts. Zeus lived The life of Riley then in the upper air, with clouts O f thunder and strokes of the rod of lightning lording it; And pressed divinity small into the bull, the swan, the eagle, The golden dancing gnats, when tugged by Love, the immortal, For one of the black earth\u2019s mortal sons and daughters. \n￼A Relief of Pan Standing behind you in the looking-glass I saw my foolish admiration cross Your own dispassionate appraisal of your dress. I met your eyes, I saw you wished me gone, I thought of that man by the Zappeion Who likewise could not let you be in peace. I had gone looking for a sanctuary of Pan Along the dry Ilissos, you by the drinking-fountain Sat eating cherries. I had gone------------------------------------- Looking unsuccessfully/-! had goug_________________-or a re-Uof- of Pan and k e Meanwhile, your gentleman of the Zappeion, Was proffering you his member round an ilex tree. Brother of mine, the Nymphs will not come down To dead Ilissos, nor can you watch at home A girl before her glass from nakedness become Clothed like a stranger at the drinking-fountain Nor watch her put off every ornament again Saving a jewellery o f cherries. I can, I do. Yet I imagine being found One day in shrubs below her window or by stairs She might descend or shuffling after her in queues, Eyes down, with cunning mirrors on my shoes. I think it will amaze the officers To learn what lady I have importuned. :----------------------------- ----------------J\u2014\u2014J______.___________ 50 / \n￼Perdita The brusqued sun returned, but milder, as Through leaves over water, and silence too, After the sprung lock, a clamour of birds On the lake in the heart\u2019s forest settling. Then nothing was between them but her bed And that narrow. Come near to either bank And staring neither saw when they began At the throat the undressing very much of The other\u2019s appearing nakedness since the eyes Across the pause held them to their purpose By force of looking face to face. Only When she reached for the counterpane he saw How bare her hand was and how thin her wrist When she took off the covers and they stood Shivering and unable to get breath Beside a girl\u2019s sheets who with solemn dolls Behind thin flowery curtains lessening The strongest light had owned, until he backed With pressing hands the blank door to, a room As still as the heart pool of a forest. \n￼Love in the Dark We loved the rain, it bathed our minds to think of The replenishing rain. On a morning then The cloud had lifted and we saw the whiter Splash of the stream at the cwm mouth and the wall Through which the bracken trickled. Behind that dyke Ownerless herds of fire cropped, unhousing Little birds but leaving springs in hoofmarks and On a craterous level above two valleys The lake where once in a cotton grass summer White gulls lifted quietly from the surface And we undressed to bathe. I showed you afterwards Blood on a stone, feathers and a bridge of bone. Love of the dark, love of the falling silent O f everything but the stream... We left the road At nights, we trespassed over the properties By the white clue of the climbing stream, by red Lanterns of rowan. Above the stepping falls Under the lintel of the lion-gate fold And through a hog^/hole in the cyclopean wall We entered our sleep like children. Hand in hand we Ran some distance to the last skyline. The lake Still lay in a sun- and moonlight at a time O f the soft drifting o f cotton grass or when Ice clouded over our full crater of rain.
