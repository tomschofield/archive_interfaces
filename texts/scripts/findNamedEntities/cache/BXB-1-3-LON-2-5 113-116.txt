Altogether, it is not surprising that Connolly had limited sympathy with the skilled Protestant working- class in Belfast. This class (now reduced in numbers and influence) has, indeed, proved unsympathetically prone to put Unionism before trade unionism when exhorted to do so. In Over the Bridge violent bigotry defeats the language of brotherhood. Yet traditional Connolly- ite concepts may over-stress the degree to which Protestant workers have been manipulated or duped, and over-mythologise strategic cross  sectarian solidarity during essentially economic campaigns like the Outdoor Relief strike of 1932. Peadar O\u2019Donnell notes: \u2018it is often in the name of his fierce Orange beliefs that [an Orangemen] enters a progressive fight\u2019.13 Henry Patterson argues that more \u2018serious analysis of Protestant politics...might have prevented the easy identification of intransigent class opposition to bourgeois Unionism with a nationalist or republican position\u2019.14 (In today\u2019s recession working-class loyalists may criticise middle-class Unionist indifference to their needs, but see the Fair Employment Agency as a device for transferring jobs to Catholics.) What of John Hewitt\u2019s attitude to Connolly? In \u2018No Rootless Colonist\u2019 he recalls his youthful \u2018vague sense of a romantic Irish nationalism, with Oisin and Connolly, Maeve and Maud Gonne, bright in the sky\u2019; but also insists: \u2018our politics looked beyond to the world. Sacco and Vanzetti were, for us, far more significant than any of the celebrated \u201cfelons of our land\u201d.\u2019 15 Once again Hewitt questionably severs Ireland\u2019s myths and mists from the real or great world. In fact his juvenilia, verse written in the late 1920s, establish no clear hierarchy of political values. He did indeed write a poem about the controversial death-sentences passed on the American anarchists Sacco and Vanzetti (1927). But he also wrote two elegies for Connolly and \u2018Song for M ayday\u2019 (1928), which ends: .. .in my dreams I see a host of hero martyrs who are dead: John Brown, James Connolly, and Christ, for you I wear my ribbon red. \u2018Easter Tuesday\u2019 and \u2018To the Memory of James Connolly\u2019 also equate Connolly with Christ. However, in Hewitt\u2019s early notebooks salutes to the dead of 1916 mingle with laments for First World War victims and veterans, attacks on Ulster Unionists and English Tories, and scorn for Ramsay MacDonald\u2019s betrayal of the British Labour Party. His radicalism seems at once ardent and promiscuous. \n￼114 PROGRESSIVE BOOKMEN What does begin to emerge is a Northern dissidence. \u2018Dublin: Easter 1928\u2019 notices \u2018the barefoot children in the street\u2019, and ends: \u2018T h e only change w rought by new law - the pillarboxes now are green\u2019. In 1929 Hewitt wrote \u2018Two sonnets on the Free State Censorship Bill\u2019 which call up Swift to say the bitter thing Or pen the words that hiss and stab and sting And flay the foul flesh of the Pope\u2019s brigade. Certainly this puts the issue more bluntly than do Yeats\u2019s resorts to Swift\u2019s \u2018sibylline frenzy blind\u2019. A year later in \u201d98\u2019 Hewitt doubts his credentials, as a non-Dubliner, to write about \u2018MacDonagh, Plunkett, Pearse\u2019, whereas: \u2018I know well where William O rr,/ McCracken, Dixon, talked before/those brief bright weeks of \u201998/bore them away to brutal fate.\u2019 This is an early sign of the Ulster Protestant writer\u2019s tendency to use 1798 rather than 1916 as a radical benchmark - and one which may define difference from, rather than solidarity with, the Southern state. (Tom Paulin\u2019s excoriations of the Republic are a recent case in point.16) Sam Hanna Bell, who described his younger self as \u2018a radical with a faint Nationalist colouration\u2019 and \u2018a nostalgic hankering for 1798\u2019, found the Presbyterian radicals attractive partly as an alternative to most versions of Nationalism then on offer.17 His novel A M an Flourishing (briefly discussed in the previous essay) measures the moral decline of a former \u201998 Volunteer by the fact that he becomes a capitalist and strike-breaker, rather than by any culpable indifference to the rest of the island. Bell at one time helped to edit Labour Progress. Similarly, Hewitt\u2019s favourite United Irishman was James Hope, the weaver of Templepatrick, whom he salutes along with William Thompson as \u2018the brave old pre-Marx Marxists of Ireland\u2019.18He also revered Mary Ann McCracken. These emphases contrast with those of an older writer, the Protestant Republican Denis Ireland (1894-1974). Whereas Hewitt and Bell dwell on the Northern and proto-socialist \u201998, Ireland wrote a book on W olfe T one called Patriot Adventurer (1936) and turned out courageous but repetitious polemics with titles like Six Counties in Search ofa Nation (1947). He carried consistency so far as to abstain from a Bell symposium nominating \u2018The Best Books on Ulster\u2019, because \u2018the books that have enlightened me about Ulster have always been books about Ireland as a whole\u2019.19No socialist (as well as no regionalist) Ireland rejected \u2018Connolly the economic thinker\u2019, while declaring: \u2018Connolly the patriot will live for ever\u2019.20Thus Connolly\u2019s choice of 1798 (let alone a conjectural Gaelic collective) \n￼Longley 109-129 4/5/94 11:05 am Page PROGRESSIVE BOOKMEN 115 as the cornerstone for an all-Ireland socialist edifice, does not understand the potential fissures within the tradition he claims. | One obvious fissure is religion: presumably Hewitt was an atheist by 1930 when he castigated the Pope\u2019s resolve to \u2018pray for Russia\u2019, doubting his moral authority to \u2018point/a jewelled finger at the Slav\u2019s disgrace\u2019. Like later references to Catholicism in H ew itt\u2019s poetry - \u2018the lifted hand between the mind and truth\u201921- this shows how hard it is for an Ulster Protestant radical to tread the line between atheism or secularism and anti-Catholicism. Any \u2018superstition\u2019 destined to wither away is bound to have a popish aura. (This was true in 1798 - and 1789.) However, the campaigns of \u2018the Pope\u2019s brigade\u2019 were then alienating socialists and writers throughout Ireland. This is why MacNeice\u2019s \u2018Eclogue from Iceland\u2019 (1936) celebrates Connolly in a roll-call of \u2018Soldiers of fortune, renegade artists, rebels and sharpers\u2019 who have kept the faith but lost the batde: \u2018There was Connolly/Vilified now by the gangs of Catholic Action\u2019. Catholic Action was an umbrella for para-religious groups, flourishing in the 1920s and 1930s,/whose propaganda helped to ensure that Catholic doctrine woula prevail in the institutions of the Free State. A North Light spells out H ew itt\u2019s distaste for the Republican- socialist axis. Looking back from the early 1960s, he tells how he met fellow radicals in a Belfast pub, the Brown Horse, in 1937, and agreed to become literary editor of a new journal, the Irish Democrat. (He had long been contributing poems to leftist periodicals such as the Irishman and Worker\u2019s Voice.) His inaugural manifesto urged: \u2018Proletarian writers of Ireland Unite! We must mobilise against War and fascism.\u201921Yet the unity of the Democrat itself fell apart after it began to be edited from London. Hewitt says: By means I have never been able to understand, The Democrat became the monthly organ of the Connolly club, a Communist-inspired Irish Association in London, and continues to this day. It seems to me now an altogether deplorable production, its pages well padded with the words of sentimental Irish songs...Wildly wrong in its interpretation of Irish affairs, foolishly supporting the reactionary I.R.A., lacking in frankness, blatantly opportunist, it has nothing to do with what we intended. But he adds, movingly: Yet when, on the fringes of an open-air meeting in an English city, a young man with a thick brogue invites me to buy a copy, I always experience a momentary thrill of emotion for those far away days of the Left Book Club, The Popular Front, Aid for Spain, the snug in the Brown Horse, and take my copy and, turning its pages, rage at the betrayal o f our dream. -0- \n￼Longley 109-129 4/5/94 11:05 am Page 116 PROGRESSIVE BOOKMEN T h e poetic corollary to all this can be traced in H ew itt\u2019s and M ac  Neice\u2019s similar reactions to Goodbye, Twilight (1936), an anthology edited by Leslie Daiken. Daiken\u2019s introduction attacks \u2018the capitalist Free State\u2019, \u2018Ireland\u2019s unregenerate manhood\u2019, \u2018the betrayal o f the national aspirations by the Treaty of 1921 \u2019 (his italics), Joyce\u2019s \u2018thorough-going isolationism\u2019 and Yeats\u2019s \u2018Twilight renaissance\u2019.22 One of Hewitt\u2019s two reviews, while hankering after \u2018a real sharp and singing contribution...from the workers and peasants\u2019, runs into a conflict between Marxism and aesthetics: We recognise that no art can...be entirely independent of its economic background...But we will not submit to the crying down of Browning, say, as a middle-class tourist, or the crying up of 36 of these 40 poets as poets...this book is...final. Rockbottom.23 His review in the Irish Democrat queries the anthology\u2019s unitary subtitle - Songs o f the Struggle in Ireland. Because of \u2018Too much weight on the Southern contributions\u2019, \u2018the Irish Struggle becomes the Free State or Republican Struggle\u2019; whereas: \u2018The Irish struggle has many variations and is being fought out in Derry and Strabane, in Sandy Row and Short Strand.\u201924Hewitt\u2019s keenest thrusts conflate stylistics and politics: \u2018The old counters are proffered again and again...Ireland\u2019s Dead, The People, The Name of Tone...Dark Rosaleen\u2019. He remarks that the \u2018majority of these poets, if they write from experience, must have spent the greater part of their lives at republican conventions\u2019.25 Thus, despite his hostility to Yeats\u2019s politics, Hewitt accepts Yeats as the public voice to beat, rather than to be dispatched into the twilight zone: \u2018If anyone can make poetry of the stuff of politics he can...Stand on his shoulders, and there get your wider vision.\u201926 MacNeice discusses Goodbye, Twilight in the chapter of The Poetry ofW .B. Yeats (1941) which compares Yeats to contemporaries and successors, both Irish and English. From his own double vantage- point, and perhaps staking his own double claim, MacNeice too finds literary cliche and political contradiction: proletarian poetry will have to become a great deal less bourgeois; at the moment it relies upon cliches, and is trying to fight the bourgeois with his own discarded weapons...Some of the poems...are marked by a deliberate irreverence towards the Celtic renaissance...such poems, being conditioned by Irish dislikes, are still specifically Irish. Other poems...are the conven  tional utterance of the international working class ...Many, however, are still blatantly nationalistic and some are even devoutly Roman Catholic.D Goodbye, Twilight irritates MacNeice and Hewitt into taking particu  larly fierce issue with the Marxist axiom that propaganda and liter- ","docTitle":"","docDate":"1994-04-05"},"meta":{"contentType":"text/raw","emVer":"7.1.1103.5","langIdVer":"DefaultLangId","processingVer":"CalaisJob01","submissionDate":"2014-07-01 09:58:14.581","submitterCode":"57b17a53-6e34-87b0-20ff-a419896f49c9","signature":"digestalg-1|KAhTUakV1AbpW0JcMv+WJE1iEx0=|QtBN+cAS/K9RO+lZggTUu8SLpzBkgiBLMN1crZ6jdXIeneelrBinrw==","language":"English"}},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/cb65e1cf-f76e-301b-ab88-bb4e24382030/cat/1":{"_typeGroup":"topics","category":"http://d.opencalais.com/cat/Calais/Politics","classifierName":"Calais","categoryName":"Politics","score":0.8},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/cb65e1cf-f76e-301b-ab88-bb4e24382030/lid/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http://d.opencalais.com/lid/DefaultLangId/English"},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/72bcc502-ead9-3ef4-8a06-46378a07c765":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"Organization","name":"Left Book Club","organizationtype":"N/A","nationality":"N/A","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/Organization","instances":[{"detection":"[ thrill of emotion for those far away days of the ]Left Book Club[, The Popular Front, Aid for Spain, the snug in]","prefix":" thrill of emotion for those far away days of the ","exact":"Left Book Club","suffix":", The Popular Front, Aid for Spain, the snug in","offset":7935,"length":14}],"relevance":0.084},"http://d.opencalais.com/pershash-1/25702702-db79-3ca0-a6fa-50ecc68f1f0c":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"Person","name":"Ramsay MacDonald","persontype":"N/A","nationality":"N/A","commonname":"Ramsay MacDonald","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/Person","instances":[{"detection":"[Unionists and English Tories, and scorn for ]Ramsay MacDonald[\u2019s betrayal of the British Labour Party.
