At any road a Scottish male of a certain age stands hopeful, hesitating, lost. He scuffs the dust, unable to go on or back. I want to see him on the rack. Compressed or stretched, the heresies will show. And mock him carefully, you who go to govern or deplore, judging or not judging, in all events undone. The riders of our times left notes behind of intrigues high and low; one sings of love, another of the shredding of a document... He scans these tales of power - screwed up, corrupt, infolded, though I would not have it so. bc>V6 v.ttV-&s \n￼Mazed It was the things the women said fair mazed our Jim ; contrary shocks crazed him as they do with rats. First they taught him sensitivity, to chop onions very fine and cry, prioritise the lady of his life. He got the knack. Applause! Then she whose absence still defines these screwey situations, left to flame it with his pal Bill. Live for friends, get in touch with your distress. But soon enough his distresses got in touch with him - a right good kicking filled him in. His bruises were stupendous; in diverse beds he was rewarded, sundry titbits showered on him. Then Jenny came from Aberdeen to say Enough. Binge-time is over, the cheese is moved. Work, discipline, avoiding dread diseases will be the key-notes o f the 90s. Without political understanding thereisonlypain- gosniffitout. Certitude of the educators, high ground of the women, tests of the high heid yins! Quivering, ardent - a rapier, a whippet, as easily broken - she raps him on the chest: Nowyou mustforgetyourfeelings. Sod this for a game of mazes. He resigns. On his back for days, pinky feet in the air. What you doing, Jim? Minding the ceiling, and its bars... \n￼Shetland He sailed for Shetland, very near the edge, to bog & cliff & a celibate friend. She did her helpless best by him. He climbed all day and failed to fall. Light-hoarding stars above her bed, a full moon on the wall - he wanted to be dead, and badly. A mortal sin, she said, I tried it. Well, she was Catholic but that stuck. No way out but up. At the c r u ^ he clutched into the chimney\u2019s heart an eaved... He taped his knuckles, she poured the wine. Only reflected light this tenderness, but still that night they lay like pardoned thieves - baffled, eased, beside her moon, beneath her paper stars. 24 \n￼About Tess She cocks her head, considers another country, you. Smoke infiltrates your throat. The rasp that says you\u2019re not dead yet is the trigger of seductions. \u2018And do you eveil^she enquires, \u2018act on your irresolution?\u2019 The bar\u2019s de-stabilised, you colonize each other as folkies sing of Nicaragua. \u2018All right,\u2019 one hand on hers, the other grips your car keys, \u2018Why not?\u2019 There are reasons, but they melt like wax. Relax. Tonight you cross the border. You cast huge shadows as you get into the car. \n￼Tess, in Tunisia Released, she tilts over on her side. \u2018The Fall is only that,\u2019 she says shaking sand from her hair, \u2018when yoiAvish returns to Paradise. Go on, forget her.\u2019 She says we are inventing new ways of shipping men and women and all her art is aiming for a raft that swimmers reach and share. She says this that it may be so. You did not worry as you lay beached together through a starless night; an obscured moon still pulls the tides of billow-talk and pillow-friends. These words come from Proverbs, Tess, and the Koran; dogs bark above our heads and yet the caravan moves on. \n￼Love-Torn Squaddie in Rannoch Torment Being, show me your ground. Only the moor and a keep of castellated cloud and the wind moving on as she did, snagged enough to make roots whine like children left behind. He waits for his heart to stop but it won\u2019t. That\u2019s all the ground there is, soldier, it\u2019s all ground, even the airy-fairy cloud-castle on the hill, even the shrilling in your chest. Being torn between moving on and being left behind, he wavers shredded among heather.
