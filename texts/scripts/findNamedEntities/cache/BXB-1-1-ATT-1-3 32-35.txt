I reckon I\u2019d have made it if it wasn\u2019t for that bastard sunstrip - no one told me they had been made illegal under that poxy new Articulacy Act and I hadn\u2019t bothered to take it off, which was a dead giveaway. I was shitting myself when I got here, what with all the rumours about those Red bastards torturing people with books and chess sets and copies of the Guardian and so on, but, believe it or not, I\u2019m having a great time! Yeah, straight up! Didn\u2019t look good to begin with though. When they checked us through the perimeter gates things were really grim. The whole of the camp is surrounded by this huge moat full of what looks like soya milk, and it\u2019s guarded by loads of pit bull terriers with really fierce lesbians on long leads - even if you get through them, there are two huge barbed wire perimeter fences that really rip your clothes, with an illuminated strip in the middle covered in that really thick motor oil that absolutely ruins your trainers. Anyone who did manage to get out would be looking at well over a grand for a completely new set of gear, at least. And the illuminated oil strip is kept under constant surveillance by hundreds of teachers and social workers who watch your every movement from massive ivory towers. It was well scary, I can tell you! But when we got inside...wow! First of all, we were met by these really nice birds who gave us all \u2018Canvey Island Zen Stalinist Theme Gulag\u2019 baseball caps, and then the camp commander - an old geezer called Billy something who seems alright, as it goes - gave us a welcoming speech in which he told us not to worry, the external security system was not at all representative of life inside, and as long as we didn\u2019t try to escape we\u2019d all have a whale of a time since the theme of this particular gulag was Saturday Night in August on the Costa del Sol, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year! And then the welcoming party started... At first we couldn\u2019t believe it at all. After all, this was supposed 32 3 ' The Gulag Archipelago-^ro \n￼^ vT- A *Jc Attila 22-37 18/9/92 12:30 am Page 33, \u2014 to be the Reds\u2019 most notorious prison camp, the one no one had ever escaped from - but when they turned on the lager fountain and brought out the paella and the disco began I thought hey, why would anyone WANT to escape? If you lot in the Tory Resistance knew what was going on here you\u2019d tear up your membership cards and start fighting the pit bulls and lesbians to try and get IN! It\u2019s officially called a work camp, but there\u2019s hardly any work to do cos everything we need is flown in from your side - volun  teers go down to the airstrip once a week to unload the food and videos and lager off the supply planes, and yours truly always volunteers of course,'cos it means I get to \u201close\u201d some of the stuff on the way back, if you get my drift, though there isn\u2019t much point actually since everything\u2019s free anyway. Old habits die hard, eh? But the rest of the time - party! Unlimited free condoms! Un  limited booze! We\u2019ve got cable TV with 215 channels, and we\u2019ve even got our own camp newspaper, run by the bloke who owned that Sunday Sport before the revolution - so you guessed it. PHWOAR! None of that boring news stuff at all! Though I hear rumours that things are pretty bad outside - apparently the Reds have renationalised the air industry now. Bloody Commie bastards! You know what we used to say in the good old days - there\u2019s no such thing as a free breath! All in all, what with their bloody Articulacy Act and the raising of the school leaving age to 20 and all that socialism and national  isation and health service nonsense (whoever thought we\u2019d be hear  ing that rubbish again, I thought the 1990s killed it off for good!) I reckon I\u2019m better off in here! Although I must tell you that there\u2019s one thing here that really worries me. Some of the people here, most of them actually, believe it or not, started to get bored with all the non-stop partying and discos and booze and sex and videos after a couple of months and they\u2019re going quite voluntarily into this big building marked REHABILITATION where all they do is sit around reading books and talking! Every day loads of teachers and social workers come down from their ivory towers on the camp boundary to take part in discussion groups and sometimes people don\u2019t come out of there for days - there\u2019s plenty of sleeping accommodation, and it\u2019s tucked away in a corner of the camp, and they just stay there! And when they do come out...well, I can tell you, sometimes it\u2019s horrible. One of my best mates from the Resistance, an old / bloke eaUed Garry-who used to be quite a famous Sun journalist before the Reds rounded them up after the Battle of Wapping and 33 \n￼Attila 22-37 18/9/92 12:30 am Page 34, stuck them in here, spent two whole weeks in rehabilitation and when he came out he started talking about Zen Stalinism and the United Communists\u2019 education programme and the bloody Artic  ulacy Act and - get this - how the global AIDS plague wasn\u2019t the homosexuals\u2019 fault at all! He called me a neanderthal - I had to ask one of the teachers to tell me what it meant - and he even tried to get me to go to rehabilitation! I mean, what a traitor! I was going to get a few of the old gang together (though most of them are in rehabilitation too now, I\u2019m sad to say) and give him a right old kicking, but the next thing I knew - he\u2019d gone! \u2018I\u2019ve gone over to the other side\u2019, the note read, \u2018to help supervise the returning of the United Kingdom\u2019s air supply to its proper place in the pub  lic domain!\u2019 Wanker! Wey-hey! I\u2019ve just seen the latest issue of the Gulag Grope, our paper! Talk about jugs! And I\u2019ve got to go cos the curries are here, and there\u2019s another party starting in a couple of minutes. PARTYYYYY!! Hope you manage to destroy those new hospitals and schools the Reds are building - SMASH THE ARTICULACY ACT and GOD SAVE THE KING!! My so-called mates might be going soft but me - never! I reckon I might just pop down to rehabilitation tomorrow, though; just to check out the birds, like, not cos Zen Stalinism means anything to me, no way... Rule Britannia!
