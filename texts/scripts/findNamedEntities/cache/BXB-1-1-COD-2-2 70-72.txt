For around you, Former charioteer lying a long corpse in the choking dust, Our best and theirs struggled and died, all day and Never should have desisted but God the Thunderer Stopped us with a storm. Then we carried you out of battle To the ships and laid you on a bed and washed Your body clean with warm water and ari/binted you. The Danaans wept for you, Achilles, gathering round, And cut their hair. And your mother when she knew Came out of the sea with the Nymphs who do not die And over the sea there arose a terrible crying. The soldiers were afraid and would have fled into the ships Had not our Nestor, the long rememberer and frequent Giver of good advice, restrained them saying: \u201cDo Not run, it is his mother and her immortal i^ymphs Come to look upon the face of her dead son.\u201d The Achaeans Recovered their courage. The daughters of the Old Man of the Sea Dressed in the robes of unending life stood around you Weeping, and the Nine Muses took up among them To and fro the death-song and every soldier there was moved By the Nine thus singing, to and fro, such singing, And wept. For seventeen days and seventeen nights Achilles We mourned you, men who would die themselves together In one company with iirjortals, and gave you to the fire On the eighteenth day, butchering fat sheep in sacrifice And cattle. You burned in clothing of the gods, you were sweet jm d rich with salves and honey and as you burned our bravest, \"Bearing their weapons, circled the pyre in chariots and on foot, Crying aloud. Burning like a forge when the flames had consumed you At dawn we collected your white bones Achilles And laid them in pure wine and oil. Your mother gave us A golden urn, the gift, she said, of the god Dionysos, The work ofgreat Hephaestos. Therein we placed your bones, Famous Achilles, together with those of Patroklos, Son ofMenoetios, who died before you. The bones ofAntilochos, C*Whom you loved above all others when Patroklos was dead,~~^)- 70 ---- > next O' \n￼|MStGT N/t-vsi ------------------- \u2014 ^ vioo Uved aA>os/e aA\\ esthers* ouV\\en PadrDblo^ was* de&d^ I ¥ e plated close by and over all we soldiers raised A colossal mound on a high headland above The Hellespont where the waters widen so that in our Generation and in all generations to come Men at sea will mark it from a great distance.\u2019 [Odyssey, XXIV. 35 71 r \n￼The Hymn to Demeter Listen. I shall recite the old story Concerning Demeter, Our Lady of the Lovely Hair, And Persephone, her daughter, who was good At running, skipping, dancing and whom Aidoneus, The Receiver of Corpses, raped whilst her Own father, Zeus, the biggest noise among The host in Heaven, turned his eyes, famous For missing nothing, the other way. Golden Demeter, who we reap with sickles, who loads Our laps with'fruit, had let her go out of sight. She was playing in a meadow by the streams O f Ocean with his daughters, the Nymphs, Whose beauty were we ever to see them With bare breasts would dement us. She was picking flowers, Roses, crocuses and pretty violets, Irises and hyacinths, but for a particular flower, A narcissus put up by Gaia, the Earth, To ple^e Hades, on God\u2019s say-so, for this Outshining flower the girl, herself Like an opening flower, reaching was caught. But any Human being for his life-span and any god For ever would have looked with amazement On that flower which from the root rose to a cluster Of a hundred blooms and their scent was such That the wide sky above and the whole earth And the salt waves of the sea smiled. The girl, Breath-taken, was reaching out both hands For Gaia\u2019s beautiful toy when the ground That bears our footpaths there and then, in Nysa on the plaii, came open and the Lord who plucks Us all in fistfuls, son of Kronos, many-named, Horsedrawn rose upon her. She was light. She could not root there like the olive trees. She fell on his scything arm like a thin sheaf Crying in a girl\u2019s high voice to Zeus, ","docTitle":"","docDate":"2014-07-01 09:47:51.973"},"meta":{"contentType":"text/raw","emVer":"7.1.1103.5","langIdVer":"DefaultLangId","processingVer":"CalaisJob01","submissionDate":"2014-07-01 09:47:51.318","submitterCode":"57b17a53-6e34-87b0-20ff-a419896f49c9","signature":"digestalg-1|M+PvuFUmmN5JVYbRIPsjNyYyenA=|U57P1glXS/ArGtxxURSujY4wpveOLQE8FaDYIX2aU1WTR737X8QYSg==","language":"English"}},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/64e049af-5eaf-3fee-8b17-03c7451e2ff9/lid/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http://d.opencalais.com/lid/DefaultLangId/English"},"http://d.opencalais.com/pershash-1/8d951bac-c83a-397d-99ad-312b5b09b7f2":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"Person","name":"Golden Demeter","persontype":"N/A","nationality":"N/A","commonname":"Golden Demeter","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/Person","instances":[{"detection":"[ eyes, famous For missing nothing, the other way. ]Golden Demeter[, who we reap with sickles, who loads Our laps]","prefix":" eyes, famous For missing nothing, the other way.
