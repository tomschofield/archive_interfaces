Although latterly dwarfed by the Police Station and Sheriff Court opposite, an architectural survey recently lauded its structure from hood-moulded main door to hattlemented tower, not to m ention the pulpit'!; fine expression of the crescendo of the Gothic revival... We\u2019d never have guessed (far less cared) when as children we fidgeted on hard pews, that those encompassing walls in future years would be praised as scholarly perpendicular - a paradox sharpened by the then snobbery of the town\u2019s more class-conscious clergy one of whom murmured, after his ordination, \u2018Of course St Marnock\u2019s isn\u2019t on the map, Conn\u2019. Throughout his calling, in ways I was then too young to comprehend, he remained his own man: voicing concern for single mothers, whom the Kirk\u2019s committees saw as \u2018fallen women\u2019; and believing an unfashionable ecumenicalism the way to enlightenment, debating at Coodham and courting the Kilmarnock Standard\u2019s abuse by counting among his friends, RC priests. As through a glass darkly, I have come to a more comprehending admiration for the industry and integrity he must have channelled into his ministry - rather than any inheriting of beliefs: partly because he never exerted pressure but permitted me to go my own way, doubtless praying it would not be to purgatory. 22 .-T-bJ \n￼Conn 10-3 L 3/5/95 10:58 pm Page 23 Those moments uppermost, at a lifetime\u2019s remove, of austere ritual, redeemed by love under the lights of the Christmas tree; and at harvest festivals, ripe sheaves round the walls of the shadowy vestibule, fruit heaped before the communion-table, then the delivery of flowers and vegetables by the Bible Class: a child\u2019s view of the tangible manifestations of others\u2019 belief in Divinity, not the tenets sustaining it. Today the building stands, like a preserved dragon - forbidding still, but no longer breathing flame. 23 \n￼Conn 10-31 3/5/95 10:58 pm Page 24 & Supper Party At a recent supper party, the guest placed next to my wife responded to her enquiry as to where he grew up, with the precise street name and nun^ber of my adolescent days; house and bedroom, nay intimate sanctuary, once his. W hat\u2019s moreAhe had actually been born in our dining-room. Animated but respecting one anotheVs privacies, we concentrate on a decorous comparing of notes; picture ministerial fathers whose tenure dated from different World Wars; and so, less alter than pre and post egos, excise from the ebb and flow of reminiscence such minutiae as, lapping against Bare toes, might superimpose the surge of massive seas. 24 f) \n￼Castles Loudoun little more than a shell, which in its day bore the title 'Windsor of the north'. At Dundonald, yowes graze in a king's resting-place. With groined vault, blocks of ashlar, Craigie more than a match for any, till its tower-house abandoned by the Wallaces, and ruined. Made watter-ticht wi diligence at a michtie princess's expense Dean's minstrel gallery a reminder of the Boyds' puissance and grandeur. Colourful still, their forays; names given to school houses - Loudoun, Dundonald, Craigie, Dean: red, blue, yellow, green.
