The statues have lost their piercing whiteness. The herbage is less dense. Even the glass dome seems diminished in circumference. T o think my grandfather carried me here; my sons in turn /-seannin^ fthis pool for goldfish and silted coins. Now the lilies have gone. And look how tawdry the entrance has become. When we leave, we cross the shrunken Gardens, not glancing behind us. Later, at a distance, I concede that what\u2019s lost is within myself: the past cannot be repossessed. What future there is, is theirs. \n￼Fieldfare X All that\u2019s left, a ringed leg on the shore at Gullane, that belonged to a fieldfare logged in Lincolnshire four years ago. At least seven Atlantic crossings since, then caught in mid-air and spewed from a gull's gullet. In the dawn light you hug your pillow; one finger wearing its gold ring. / 97 \n￼Recovery (for Iain Crichton Smith) 1 You know now \u2018what inhuman pressures keep a line of verse on its own course\u2019. The everlasting flowers shiver in their vase. And you in a strange place believing your loved ones have turned against you. Behind incandescent mirrors to be imprisoned... All I can do is will you patience and reassurance and through them, peace of mind. 2 The poet\u2019s task, to seek significant detail in the face of horror. It has always been so - Yeats and Marvell writing out of disturbance and war. Like preserving a journal through plague years. And consider the chill chambers, now ruined, where were produced these beautiful Books of Hours. 98 \n￼3 Or do you see yourself as I lamlet in black, on black battlements waiting? Do you hear the ghost clanking, the jewelled clock within you, ticking? Mercifully things are more mundane on this side of the mirror - no one plotting to kill you; no cup of poison, no revenge tragedy, no treacherous queen. If only the trees outside your window, bristling with weaponry, could revert to an uncomplicated green; the tides off Oban sparkle, as they used to. 4 It must have been like winter closing in, the mind an icy web: whereas in your case, the metaphor a sea-loch, its surface seeming to freeze yet retaining the intellect\u2019s finery and pulsing beneath, those massive forces, endurance and love. \n￼Case Histories Let us look first at Goldilocks And these Three Bears. She takes, For my money, the biscuit: a nosey Missy, insensitive little hussy. Sir, if you\u2019re allocating responsibility, Mayn\u2019t we look at it this way: When he went out, Father Bear Could at least have bolted the front door. You\u2019ll argue next if the small Bear had Eaten his porrage, tidied his bed, There\u2019d have been no inducement for her to stay. Then you\u2019ll tell me there\u2019s a history - - of deprivation in her family. Right. You refer too glibly (Evading the real issue) to \u2018her sort\u2019. I\u2019d like to ask for a background report. Balderdash. You\u2019re so ready to berate The law-abider, defend the deviate. Anyway... let\u2019s turn to Snow-White who, as everyone knows, Shacked up with those seven little fellows. They were her good news: if they\u2019d been miffed Like the Bears, she\u2019d have had short shrift. As it was she paid her way By doing the cooking and cleaning, daily. Rubbish. She distorted the facts of life - Said her stepmother went for her, with a knife. In short, the classic schizophrenic. With an attitude to apples, far from hygienic. I reckon, sir, what\u2019s bugging you * Is: her story might be true. You Freudians are so unbending, You cannot stomach a happy ending. \n￼Quixote Rides Again (j'or Stephen MacDonald) Throughout World War Two my great-uncle Travelled the length and breadth of Ayrshire Buying horses that looked on their last legs: Seeing them carted off, folk would snigger And place bets on how long each rickle O f bones would survive. But to the dregs O f stable and stall he\u2019d administer Poultices nightly, being known never to fail. Before War ended the shire Ran out of old nags, his main purchaser, The Co-op, having Clydesdales enough.yPfet^jhen We watched him go downhill rapidly, \u2014 Giving up the mart even, on Friday, As though realising his course was run. Atlasthewaslaidtorestintheland HeAprang frony/That day it rained and rained. Other horses since have made their mark on me: Funerary figures from the T \u2019ang dynasty; This or that city\u2019s rearing statuary; The bronze mount in the Campidoglio; That flayed beast, in Dostcjevsky; Othello\u2019s neighing steeds; Faustus\u2019 noct/s equi\\ The hooves that go thundering through Dante, entrapping life\u2019s energy J j Already leaves accumulate, as last year. I.imbs encased in glass, so brittle the air, I hoist myself precariously over - and spur My baleful Rozinante to a trot; soon to be headed 1know not where, frenziedly galloping Through wastes of splintered m irrors... Those grizzled visages... Cries go unheeded. Dear Sancho, please.. .just one last thing. ( \u2014 / / /* ><d , / A ^ C-tV. .==- / [ / ' n j 101 \n￼The Return of Don Quixote '/ \u2018I cannot wait, Sancho, for you or anyone. You must realise that, from our previous Existence. Resurrection now, however devious A ploy, at least gives expression To the demons within. You do not think, surely, That I could resist the temptation, On Dulcinea\u2019s behalf and my own, To attack an age which behaves even less purely Than ours? So, stand aside While I fasten the girths, and mount. There we are... my steed... Call me to account, Sancho... whoa there... Indeed more, deride My name and ancestry, whole right to knighthood, Should I come to grief. Stand back, While I ready jnyself for the attack. Never adversaries so dastardly, by the rood.\u2019 So saying, our jaunty hero caught His helmet on a branch whose backlash swept Him to the ground. Sancho could have wept. But Quixote, coming to, had fought The battle in his head, routed evil and returned For his fair maiden\u2019s hand. Compassion Was earned; and pity, after a fashion. Sancho let him go, happy. His conscience burned. Quixote cogitates ■From my vantage point, olive trees extend Jagged branches, each silhouette Overlapping the next, cutting out light. The sun fails to come through. The fiery brand Of my beard has become a sheep\u2019s-wool hank O f nit and thorn, still my hallmark. What have I to protect me in the dark But uncured leather; cuirass in gules, rank \n￼As the carcass it was cut from; spear And shield of waning splendour; A bent blade whose shining hour Appears fated to the life hereafter. Envisaging myself I recall the adage No fool like an old one, but try With sporadic success to keep it at bay - Believing age brings, with all else, self-knowledge: As you assess me, so 1 see through you, Young caballeros eager to tilt at me, Eyes glinting with mockery, Determined to put me down, your view The fashionable one now. It is your will, Detectable in every glance, That I succumb to some fine lad\u2019s lance. But think: I may be merely his windmill. Quixote\u2019s horse's hooves go click-clack-click On the cobbles, like dominoes on a table (Or skulls, thinks Sancho, on friable Board). \u2018She reeked of garlic,\u2019 He cries vehemently - only to be rebufted: \u2018Master, her aroma was divine, 1 assure you.\u2019 \u2018I lave you been at the wine? What of the wart on -!\u2019 \u20181ler skin, soft As a babe\u2019s.\u2019 \u2018If all you wanted Was to make a fool of me, deride my name, You could have had the grace to stay at home, Not escort me here.\u2019 \u2018M aster, you are enchanted, That\u2019s what, by some malign spirit, To speak thus...\u2019 Further rejoinders Unuttered: \u2018When passion roars, The eye can overlook demerit - In other words, why study the mantelpiece When you\u2019re stoking the fire?\u2019 \u2018You demean the most ancient order O f chivalry.\u2019 \u2018Is not that the price \n￼Of succumbing to Time\u2019s inexpressible passage, Don Quixote? Had you not detected How already we have been projected Into a graver, much less courtly age?\u2019 Quixote goe* fishine 1 1leaToveTuT^oatTedge. This face Gleams back, through a web of waves: My own, but older; like leaves Floating just beneath the surface. I try casting on the other side: The features disintegrate. Nothing for it, but speculate How soon my fate will be decided. j (£ Meanwhile, is that abysmal creature Waiting for me, or going through hell On my behalft Impossible to tell. I open my mouth to shout: he does likewise, water Pouring in. When I turn my visage away To avoid witnessing his pain, He for reasons best known T o himself does the same, simultaneously. Head swimming, I cannot be sure Which of us is which; who is haunted By whom; whether he is my enchanted Self, I the one struggling underwater. Then it all comes back, too late: How I kissed my lips in the mirror When young; since when years of failure (Row, Sancho, row...) have turned self-love to hate. 104 \n￼7 \u2018A bugele-call cracks black mirrors. Having for what seems centuries lain low In this hollow hill outside Toledo, Our moment is come. With others Of like metal, we must give our services To mankind, for freedom and the rights O f the downtrodden; with the Knights O f the Round T able, step out to gain the prize, Not for ourselves, but to dedicate To those ladies, Dulcinea and others Decorously loved, down the years. So Sancho, to horse! The lanterns are lit; Our ambling nags, steeds for a day, Ready; ourselves, bruises and agues forgotten, Lager for battle; weapons tempered to a fine Point. Let us enter the fray...!\u2019 \u2018Don Quixote, when last we did this, Spain Was no longer the world we\u2019d known Hut running with the blood of wounded men. Must we risk our lives, again?\u2019 \u2018'1\u2018his time, dear Sancho, promises something rare: We shall attain to an incomparable purity - It is foretold - making us momentarily Columns of whitest ash, in the receding air.\u2019 / &LJ. / 105 ","docTitle":"","docDate":"2014-07-01 08:49:42.220"},"meta":{"contentType":"text/raw","emVer":"7.1.1103.5","langIdVer":"DefaultLangId","processingVer":"CalaisJob01","submissionDate":"2014-07-01 08:49:39.755","submitterCode":"57b17a53-6e34-87b0-20ff-a419896f49c9","signature":"digestalg-1|CrsYNyZ3rpBmEaT0lPdpCN6dOR8=|jQDuXcmf1+7MT+8cQinkl12jxpAWAGm8kTiBE5wjEw4hBM8ZVSbB0g==","language":"English"}},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/8d86e7a0-0b0f-32db-9ea2-4f702e3e5fa9/lid/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http://d.opencalais.com/lid/DefaultLangId/English"},"http://d.opencalais.com/pershash-1/85c75472-0582-32ad-aaab-6182876c14c0":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"Person","name":"Stephen MacDonald","persontype":"N/A","nationality":"N/A","commonname":"Stephen MacDonald","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/Person","instances":[{"detection":"[a happy ending. \n￼Quixote Rides Again (j'or ]Stephen MacDonald[) Throughout World War Two my great-uncle]","prefix":"a happy ending. \n￼Quixote Rides Again (j'or ","exact":"Stephen MacDonald","suffix":") Throughout World War Two my great-uncle","offset":3578,"length":17},{"detection":"[survive.
