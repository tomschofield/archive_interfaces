That's how come we get on so well, so long. You smile, you picture black seamed stockings, white muslin crown on hair that's (£y-iag to be let down? No, she is not Naughty Lola - nor Mrs Mopp! Vith us it is importunate to talk or stare; touch is right out. This fortunate proximity is all we share. She has arrived. You are in the backroom, by the Steinway, fiddling with the Blues. You hear her humming as she moves among the papers and abandoned meals, clearing up the ashtrays, scripts and coffee cups, the litter of aloneness. Redeeming fingers touch your old scores lightly, as if it were yourself she dusts and settles on the shelf. Praise the maid who sets out flowers and white clouds where you might see them and be glad! The shambles would be total were it notfor her. Now she is singing an old refrain you can't quite ... The sky is pale, washed clean by rain, hung up against the evening. As you attend, a melody floats through apartment walls so intimately it is as though you quote yourself - debris is sorted, order is invented or restored. Now she is done. You willwork on alone but that's alright. Gracemust have its means. She flicks the light on as she leaves. / \n￼VALLACE STE7EIS II EAST FIFE If it be anywhere, it must be everywhere - a© the mind stumbles after the divine finding nowhere to halt or grip. It must be the bush and the wind that wrassles it, the invisible shook by the visible, the howl shaken from wind by telephone lines. It must be speech on the phone and the silence that resumes and speech resuming that conversation between speech and silence which so shook Samusi B., discerning howl in music, music in the throat of howl. ' It must be anytime and at all times, in the living man and the dead, in the greatcoat stumbling on the coast, in the grey coast stumbling through the head. \n￼AU<1' J w /j ,\u201e a *2 Atcsnl tv/#K 'if *7*\u2018\"r/\u2019( - c\u2019y . >7 ^ y 'ft ZCtm 7 I \\ A SOETH SEA TVIST-OFF I got oiled on my last night on-shore, remembering lovers thrown over shoulders like peel so we could read the initial of the one we shoulditbeve married or eaten wh,ole ...

It has long been my ambition to make a major blunder; now I've succeeded, for today at least. The shaft is plugged, it'll take days more to extract the cock-up from the core. Too much was going down. Ve grouped like para-medics round a cardiac arrest to bolt another section to our mile-long^probe. I did it then. Some suspect, none saw that flick of the wrist. Ve swarmed in oilskins around catastrophe, pumped down urgent cooling mud, muttered soothing angry words, Come on beauty, don't break off now .. Too late. The twist-off was complete. Ve shrugged, separated, hurt by our incompetence, glad of the break. * I need the money, I need the work, I need the green grease i?n my palms.
