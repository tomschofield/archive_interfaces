Burying the elephant What a grave it took to dig, burying the elephant, his shadow lengthened and grew dark, his shadow rolled over and was gone. 0 shock of the spirit when great things go down. He was caught in the sun\u2019s net, the sun brought him crashing down, elephant spirit meeting the ground; blue eyes muddied with a failure to rise, earth\u2019s yawn m ust bury him now. The elephant was heavy-blooded, stone full, slow with time; we all came to bury him, our blue eyes lit with ivory and a kind of grief; 1 had my own pit dug/$\\ feet up, my animal kicked with stiff limbs; in my hide my shadow rolled on the grass and groaned, my spirit grew dark and gave; elephant trum pet bellowed in the the forest sank to its knees, the forest rose and swayed. W hat a grave it took to bury my animal\u2019s meat. I turned his spirit out and now the darkness is complete. trees, \n￼Berkeley 55-96 19/8/94 5:01 pm Page 5. Man chopping wood Man chopping wood looks up to see the helmeted boys go over, he can hardly believe - men in their khaki fatigues, running hard across the no-m an\u2019s-land of his back yard. The whistles are screaming, he drops his axe; the wood smells warm, sweet, as it should; the men going over throw up their arms as they did on the old news reels, just as he had always pictured Great Uncle John who was lost on the Somme. He thought it was all black and white in the war, all hands on hearts, flags in the breeze, he\u2019s never seen men sink to their knees he\u2019s never seen them torn limb from limb he was just getting the woodpile in. His wife\u2019s in the kitchen, baking pies, his kid\u2019s on the green playing football with the neighbours\u2019 kids, he tries to scream but his voice won\u2019t come and quick as they came, they\u2019re gone, it\u2019s quiet again, smell of new wood and raw air and no knowing if history was played or statistics made, if pain was real or death hard in the no-man\u2019s-land of his back yard. se- 58 e \n￼Berkeley 55-96 19/8/94 5:08 pm Page 9, Undertow I was not gently led into that inner room. From where I lay, it always seemed another room away, and feeling the wall for a door I felt the cries of all those girls before being drawn, drowned, prom ised and offered and led to the very core, and whether willing or in dread, all swooping low and following the flow and irresistable tide knowing the undertow was where they always died, abandoning every distinguishing sign, mole, tilt and curl, number and name, until they were all the same and it fell cold as a cave in the room, they stood holding the spent flame, wanting to put it down, bury it now it was done and move with the ease of girls who know themselves, into a different room. Once their sound turned down, my hands began to burn from holding m em ory\u2019s hand. I laid them flat on the cool sheet and turned my other cheek, lying easy in a white bed, wondering when would I be given up for dead. 90 e \n￼Berkeley 55-96 19/8/94 5:07 pm Page 8, A week left It is clean inside my head, there\u2019s been a storm; things leap there, up the salmon-falls the sun leaps, the brightness, the good feel of the day. A m oth goes fluttering into the blue candle of the past; for miles both ways the road is the same; the houses, the gates; only the people back in my room the belongings squat, soon they will huddle, sad and packed away. My fists grow small. There\u2019s a week left. I want to think only of good times - I am sixteen and tanned and my fringe is too long; I am thirteen and playing kid, the round heart of sunlight is almost at my fingertips, the house opens like a flower, doors are flung wide; or I am nine and in a new dress, it ripples and creases dark and light, but there\u2019s a week left, and I feel stones inside. I will open my eyes wide, I will open my ears, I will try to call some colour to my smile; the days form a ring, they have numbers pinned to their backs the weight is doubling them, their grim dance shakes me from limb to limb there are seven of them. 87 \n￼Berkeley 55-96 19/8/94 5:01 pm Page 6, Everyone\u2019s cold He woke in the dark, blind, still inside the close nature he would like to kick off in the grass and walk from. Sun came up, but he never saw. He was trying to fathom the time by the depth of his fear he felt it was light on the street why was it so heavy in here? He got up, pulled the shutters across. The wind looked dull against the thick glass. He rode the bus to her house storm tide sucked his heart dry and flooded it full, the extra sounds kicked in, the tightness came, he reached for her throat, to him this violence felt like love turned backwards, he waited for time to begin for sun to blow the earth out, for cracks to show. \u2018Everyone\u2019s cold!\u2019 he cried, but she reminded him of love, the circle and fall, and what she said she said so simply that it broke him down, he spread till he was thin on the ground his snakeskin spirit dreamed in the grass the quiet went deep, she made him promise to let go his anger at last and bury his fear in sleep. 61 \n￼Berkeley 55-96 19/8/94 5:21 pm Page 9, After the fact Then I lay down. The train moved and I was trying not to fall back frightened. W estminster rose cold between the trees; I waited for Battersea, the satisfying way the four white towers would hold me still, a pillar at either shoulder, a pillar at either heel. W hen the desert arose, that cup of mine began to thirst for rain. I lay between two juniper trees and when the trouble came, it was quick as steel, I loosed myself to meet it. Down England\u2019s spine towards the tail of Brighton, dogs on the sand, Lowry people arm in Sunday arm along the pier. There is a way to grow into my life, to pass a hand over the damaged face without unreasonable fear. I walk the planks, beyond^candy floss and beer. It is all sea to the end of the sea from here. 96 \n￼Berkeley 55-96 19/8/94 5:21 pm Page 9, Evidence They came to the end of them, nettles took hold, the roof fell, thistles grew right down their hall; she listened to his doubtful thoughts, gathering evidence. Into other people\u2019s homes he made his solitary way, left his bones in their cold stone jars, put his hot cheek to their flagstone floors, heard only echoes there. She lay under a mountain ash keeping count of the seconds that passed; with her free hand she traced a root, circled and circled the heavy doubt, cut his name in the dark. Didn\u2019t he see the end of time chasing minutes across the face? The heavy cast of early June fell too smartly on her pain, would she ever be safe? She lay counting them to a close, in her vessel was bitter blood, truth flooded her deepest canals, truth found its own level, close to the bone. This evidence bore down, her heart felt the gavel\u2019s rap; where he WTlaid her she didn\u2019t sleep, the silent jury kept her awake, she would never be safe. She turned on her side, he knelt in his dark, kissing the life from her every joint; she counted elephants, one to ten, he said her name a final time, it was over then. 56. 93 \n￼Berkeley 55-96 19/8/94 5:21 pm Page! The man I knew He climbed on his life, hands ragged, winter-blown eyes; space revolved around his world, a million lights were lost in thought - it wasn\u2019t the dark that mattered. The man I knew threw his life in the water; the man I knew surfaced and gasped, he was survivor, kicking the boards of the boardwalk, grabbing the rails for a long haul back to the real world. His colours came through. In his single room no one held him as he wept and he was glad of no one. W ithout sight, he was ready for life; kicked dust at the stars, swung with a measure of hope, made no bones of it. All that winter his letters fluttered to m y letterbox; although I broke the hold, I turned aside, and read them all, and cried. On goes the hungry scissors up our paper lives. The whole splits, the halves roll back alone. High on his life something else, different and good, can begin. Across his sky a million lights go on, his palm ghosts the back of my neck, his memories reach out and back, he is travelling light. 95 \n￼Berkeley 55-96 19/8/94 5:01 pm Page 6, Near the end of blue Tuesday he wrote himself a note about how miserable he felt; put on clean socks, laced his boots, went out to face the weather. He sat on his step in the sun until the fog rolled in; fat fog rolls sat on the hills and blew across his road. He went inside, turned the wind down and knelt by his life, blowing for a spark. When it grew dark, he crouched in the dark, fiddling with the dials listening to the voices fade in and out spreading the weather. But news on the hour increased the interference , the hair on his neck rose he turned from the news through a snatch of songs, liquorice tunes he once whistled to. He rocked and rocked in his white board house head in his knees, casting around for himself. It came unexpectedly, like the truth right at the end^r a silence that stilled his hand - he passed through every station on earth and in the end, face down, head first, the hissing silence held him. -e- 60 / ","docTitle":"","docDate":"1994-08-19"},"meta":{"contentType":"text/raw","emVer":"7.1.1103.5","langIdVer":"DefaultLangId","processingVer":"CalaisJob01","submissionDate":"2014-07-01 09:46:42.003","submitterCode":"57b17a53-6e34-87b0-20ff-a419896f49c9","signature":"digestalg-1|C+mrsgm6hNlWSpuZTzrrmpt7/bs=|UmbmphHmSc+piZMz8ROIbMxrK2ZIYSX7uW3pp1kMmdreMfH3EjfJ8g==","language":"English"}},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/192d5655-1f57-3f33-b2ec-9cad0994a9f4/lid/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http://d.opencalais.com/lid/DefaultLangId/English"},"http://d.opencalais.com/pershash-1/34a717b1-1c60-3926-b69f-3c7f044f8c5c":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"Person","name":"Great Uncle John","persontype":"N/A","nationality":"N/A","commonname":"Great Uncle John","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/Person","instances":[{"detection":"[old news reels, just as he had always pictured ]Great Uncle John[ who was lost on the Somme.
