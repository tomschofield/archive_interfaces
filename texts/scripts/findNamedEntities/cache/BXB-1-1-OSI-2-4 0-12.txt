This world of ours is one city. \u2014 Epictetus \n￼FILTERED LIGHT Euch kommt jeden Morgen das neue Licht warm in die offene Wohnung. Und ihr habt ein Gefuhl von Gesicht zu Gesicht, und das verleitet zur Schonung. Every morning new light comes warmly into the open house and you have a feeling that moves from face to face and that leads you astray to calling. Rainer Maria Rilke (Translation: Robert Bly) \n￼Transit Urgencies of language: check-in, stand-by, take-off. Everything apace, businesslike. But I'm happy here Gazing at all the meetings and farewells. I love To see those strangers' faces so quickened and bare. A lost arrival is wandering. A moment on edge, He pans a lounge for his countersign of welcome. A flash of greeting, sudden lightening of baggage, As though he journeyed out in order to journey home. I watch a parting couple in their embrace and freeing. The woman turns, a Veronica with her handkerchief Absorbing into herself a last stain of a countenance. She dissolves in crowds. An aura of her leaving glance Travels through the yearning air. Tell me we live For those faces wiped into the folds of our being. \n￼Beyond Ask me then and I'm almost sure I'd say A hand, a turn of shoulder, some voluptuous Bend of playfulness kept inviting my caress. Those days I talked of truth and beauty. It was your expression. Those eyes that welcomed Without reserve. Openfaced, so much a brother's Keeper. It's as though we surrendered each other Freedom, freeing the other the more we succumbed It was years later I thought of Dante's Beatrice And how once you'd chided me for making fun Of an old man. Who knows what he 's undergone? A face is filtering light from beyond a face. You'd seen transparence in a stranger's infinite Gaze. I moved in your light to see the light. \n￼News It was a struggle, but he arrived just after one. Daniel George his father names him by telephone. An unbroken line. And so he enters our universe God's my judge, Soll-worker as his grandfathers. Who's he like? I try to imagine his countenance A little smudged, but finding its own structure From genes and traces, incessant recommencements Travelling towards a future. A recourse and rupture. It's as though two separatenesses had come together Blending their need with desire, a self and other, Some kind of surplus in a lovers' touch and go. Daniel George. One face of renewal and overflow. Yours and not yours. You are and are not your son. Fecundity's old riddle and a world moving on. \n￼Quartet. These players nod and gleam as if they're seeing And hearing the other's expression, each leaning Into the fine-nerved strings, their whole being Vested in this interplay, this gamble on meaning. I remember a crescendo dream. We burned and burned. Maybe it's age. I grow in this mutual succumbing: Bow and pluck, phrase and breath of an earned And watchful passion, our face to face becoming. All shall be equal we'd said. But nothing matches. Overlaps. Voice-overs. A sudden fertile digression Loops into our rousing silence. Something over-reache Equality, a lived-in music shaping my compassion. The conversation dips and wanders and tenses again. A shining between faces, a listening inward and open.
