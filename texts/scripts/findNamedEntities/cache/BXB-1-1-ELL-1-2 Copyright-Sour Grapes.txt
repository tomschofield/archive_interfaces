Occasionallyhegotoff, from papering alcoves and fitting laminated surfaces, to ponder on the presence of night, up in an unused bedroom. He affronted the sky with binoculars. They said he was snooping in houses for women undressing, shutting their curtains on his ancient quest. Alone with the All, the suburb righteously smoothed its skirts beneath him. His mystic charts, how an old Arab name would flare in his head like freedom! 'Al-gehiroth, delta-Lyrae', he crooned at the map of yellow nail-heads on his knees. High, high up, beyond the pouting street-lights, Orion with a cosmos in his belt fights back the charging Bull forever, Uncle James looking on, entering in his notes a Leonid shower across the moon, that swam to earth in sparkling cinders. 4 He lay in bed thinking, next to his wife's back. I am an antique Arab myself. Up there a court of primal riddles reclines along our rooftops, a repository of ageless heroes overarching us. Up there eternity is always in our faces. They would slip from protests at the price of bread to gabblings against him, but he didn't care; a man who knows all this fits surfaces differently to other men. \n￼3optk4 At a Grandparent's Funeral Divergent endeavours met on her sideboard, focussed to a family: a jumble of cousins not seen by one another for a decade were neighbours of the big clock and dead forty years, pewter-framed. Across the room, an armchair gobbled a sheath of angles sprouting a perm, her glasses imprisoning the window's of wandering sky through hours of old age till she waded to welcome us |... I recall this, head lowered. The vicar prays on for the blank space's soul that he fills in with her name, Annie. The curtains close over gleaming wood to rows of crying; the cousins are reunited. Afterwards we eat dry sandwiches in her honour, each of us pleased the different disclosed adulthoods confirm he's getting on best. Once back at home my father sits silent above the chaos of games and children across the carpet, as if he watches his own wife and sons play with the kids inside a glass case he drifts past into endless seas now Love's finely-wrought anchor has snapped. husband her up, shot \n￼The Age of Innocence At school, we all had to pick a plague out of Exodus; round the table, elbowing each other in innocent enthusiasm, the girls drew mostly feverish first-borns, the boys boils and frogs; while I fancied the river of blood. Except some little s-d had pinched all the reds. So I did locusts: houses, palm trees, pyramids carefully laid in; arabs arranged unsuspecting, § sudden camel; stood back, aimed, and ic CATS FURIOtJS blitzings with the pencil, God's green pepper milling down, marvellously missing Moses, tucked with his rifle in the margin. Our work went up round the walls, whereon the headmistress appeared in a clap of lavender, benign and gratified, and scattered gold stars like benedictions. 7 \n￼Muncaster Cricket Club 1882 Three rows of hard suspicious eyes beneath ringed caps, above moustaches; an umpire in a prophet's beard and gown; beside the boots the opening pair in symmetrical languor along the grass. Skating their names I notice a gap and circle the face that goes with it, loomingbecauseforgotten. Thiswink of history is a title more immense than the harmless double-barrels all around it. & studying him, I see the reason: the shaven walls of the head, cheek-bones like struts inside the mouth, the eyes black drills where all the other eyes seem furry now, distracted - after it was shot did he slink off at its sepia edges to butcher the baby, or bully a path through a forest of straps and underskirts, smothering her afterwards, slipping away free in the dark streets of the dark century? 4 Between the sloping shoulders of team-mates he stands in the dock after ninety years. Mine is the first face he's looked into since then. I leaf through the next decades but am followed by his freedom, even when I put the book back in its place. It tilts one end of the bookshelf like the pans of the archangel's balance. \n￼Within these walks I inter my failure: a good interview but not good enough. A walled garden: mind has found here a symbol of solace for centuries, whenever man's world or worlds fell apart - purity, peace, and perspective. 4 Here I find a place among a society of work and song; the daisies waiting on the bees, the music-boxes in the trees, the dust with wings, the butterfly scribbling himself across the sky; the chequerwork of leaves in light like silver lotion to the sight, concentrating everywhere and past and future, to a square. Yet never as now were these walks so threatened, nor mind that plans and explains them. I leave the garden, false microcosm of a raging, bullying world. 0 brother earth, you and I have no certain future; let others read tbi^day's front page trusting mortgage, marriage, and middle-age.
