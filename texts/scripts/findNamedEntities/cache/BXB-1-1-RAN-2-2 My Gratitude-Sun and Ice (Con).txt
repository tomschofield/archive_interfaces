And to Peter and Joyce who kept the home fires burning. And to my kitchen table. EbJif Vvjr ncsb£_ \n￼\"..no good or lovely thing exists in this world without its correspondent darkness.\" I f \n￼The Demon Horse. I dream of semen Unravelling from the lip and nostril Of a phantom horse A stallion Well-hung Who comes for me Like a drum And I run on the spot Where trees have dropped Their crockery He's smashing plates As he comes me His ectoplasm Ghastly on the air. I mean to mount him But the reins Are lashing like tongues The back is bare Treacherous black ice The hair A viprous frenzy. Get me out of here Before he mows me down A man ethereal Who quakes And breaks into sweat Or semen Who cannot ride The two-backed creature. \n￼We wait for each other at the white end of the world Before the world was made and we could make it. And the seal glides along the ceiling of ice, His shadow true,through a curtain of water. Water cast us on the wheel,water threw us together. And I will make you red ,will pierce the sun To give you blood. First the hood forced from your head Then the plunge. And I will turn the snow to hot hot milk Shot from the nipple. And I will kill your life before me, Your origin in the wild wild sea. \n￼Sun And Ice (con) I will softly close the hole And blow a kiss.
