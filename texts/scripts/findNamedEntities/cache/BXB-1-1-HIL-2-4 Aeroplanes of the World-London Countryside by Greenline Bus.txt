Selima Hill \n￼SELIMA HILL Lilies of the Valley The flying-helmet my late father wore smells of seals, cloud-banks, German blood. I stand in silence, shouldering a broom. At night I draw huge maps in the mud. * We stay indoors. We dye our jeans and hair. We sew black lace round everything we wear. We soak our feet in bowls of turpentine. Our knickers twinkle like a diamond mine. * Office-workers watch us from their windows coil like a snake around the square.

The bear I had at school - I want it now. Its felted ear-lobes satisfied my lips. ii The nurses call Night -night to the patients who hold their pink and yellow cake like cards.

Tlie smell of apples chills the empty house; the ghostly cows that wair below the window crunch the ice like liver. I'm alone. i4 The sea beyond the rail slips in and out its fringe of sandy foam like melted lies. Of course I think of you. The path is narrowing.

And as they sped away across the valley, I saw the children picking un the rabbits and making for the cover of the wood. Some of the rabbits were almost the size of sheep, and the children were gradually sinking into the snow, but when a man came running past,I fo\u2018lowed him. I didn't even turn to wave goodbye. The orange is exactly the same, ike certain orange fungi,or small moths. We were terrified of everything in those days, even,I remember,those small moths.

And then he said the dog I got instead had mauled,in fact had killed,his little girl. So that poor dog was put to sleep as well. You might sav Pair enough but my point is this girl was an imaginary girl. I was emoloyed,and given nroper monev, W 7 v\u2014i X J. W7 to care for noone.She was non-existent. At first I tried to sympathize with him, but after that,well,frankly,it1s not easy. I loved those dogs.Hank never left my side. A beautiful sweet-natured White Bull Terrier. My sugared\u2019almond.That's what he was like. Not only his coat,but even his lovely smell. I smelt them on my father so I know. Almost like mahogany.Or chestnuts. Chestnut and chocolate roulade,slightly warmed, and mixed with a mixture of cream and Grand Meunier. Harry was her name,the daughter's.Harriet. A spoilt little thing she was too. She treated me as if I was her servant. Do this,do that all day.It never stopned. All her father had to do was read to her. A bedtime story.When he finished work. He used to sit up there for hours some nights, telling her the most fantastic stories even I was spellbound by.It's true. More and more fantastic.In the end we had to stop because it made us cry. \u2014]o>r H?nU^ (originally Hank) \n￼Hank Everything went well until the night Wish,who was alone in the attic, was mauled by darling Dream, the white Bull Terrier I had instead of Hank,the real one. Hank was sweet,but wasn't used to children, and so we'd had to have him'put to sleep.' And when Wish died,in pain,a few days later, his father said we'Id have to put down Dream. This was understandable,I know - he couldn't help it if his only child he 'd worked so hard for was imaginary - but after that,things weren't the same between us. At first there was a narrow line,like tape, that widenned to a path,and then a road as difficult to walk across as eggs, a bowl of eggs that has no rim around it, and ncone knows what birds the eggs are from. \n￼1 5 8 i 9 10 11 12  13  14 15  16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 1 2 3 1 SELIMA HILL The Villa His famous cock that he goes on about\u2019s about as much fun as a frozen lamb, and I just ran away across the heath one night; I left the moonlit villa far behind, the helicopters, chainsaws, parrots, knives, and little maids who specialize (he gives them sweets) in screaming at the parrots; I slipped away, and came back here, to you: breathing gently like a giant flower smelling of custard being stirred, and licked - custard madeofeggs and warm vanilla pods, where egg-white islands shunt their sugar bays. / \n￼1 SELIMA HILL 5 5 i ) 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 The Villa His famous cock that he goes on about\u2019s about as much fun as a frozen lamb, and Ijust ran away across the heath one night; I left the moonlit villa far behind, the helicopters, chainsaws, parrots, knives, and little maids who specialize (he gives them sweets! in screaming at the parrots; I slipped away, and came back here, to you: breathing gendy like a giant flower sm elling o f custard being stirred, and licked - custard madeofeggs and warm vanilla pods, where egg-white isles float to Paradise. 23 94 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 1 2 J 1 / \n￼SELIMA hill The Dog-Man dog-man from next door has come to play the piano^- to pour out his syruppy notes like a deluge of ripe, exhausted plums: they stick in her hair and mess up her ironed, imported, daisy-spangled cotton dress that glares out sententiously like one of those little flower-gardens harbour-masters and sandwich-bar-owners dedicate their lives to with the kind of murderous possessiveness small seaside towns obssessed by being the nicest go over the top with; she\u2019s pressed against by plums as big as radiators, emperors, sweating Clydesdales, suicide, over-heated Japanese \u2018bath-houses for sexual relief she\u2019s read about, and puzzled over and tried not to see herself in plums buzzing with bright wasps that cross and recross the precinct of her chair like a switcned-on electric fence she can\u2019t move through.

We used to come up here most afternoons. Stacey would sit on her pillow , and, taking a lock of white hair between her fingers, would flick up the ends in a bunch and examine them, like a monkey. She had a pair of scissors in the shape of a sick-looking stork that she would snip them off with, frowning. She would carry on like this all afternoon, as if her hair were a goddess she must serve! It was me who had the crow. I kept her in the woods behind the chapel and took her for walks on my shoulder when things were quiet. Stacey would occasionally come with me, but she preferred to stay indoors. She didn't like the light. It gave her nose-bleeds. Her hair was like a mass o f tumbling roses. that\u2019s what it reminded me of - she would sit there as if she could feel a pilgrimage of insects advancing along each strand - first they would strip her bald. then they would bore through the skull. then they would sip her brain with their proboscises. She was already starting to be one of those people one avoids. I\u2019m afraid - as you know. She said she was tired of making her mother cry; she said she felt like an amputee - whether she meant her mother or herself, I'm not sure. but anyway you can imagine that talking to her was a bit like walking across soft sand in high-heeled shoes - hard work! - so I was happy to set off without her._________ .______ up the bank, and on to the brow of the hill, my lame pet crow perching on my shoulder. One day I\u2019ll let her go.

As dusk, then darkness, fall, and rumours spread, people start to gather at the inn. I hear the muffled crunch of their boots, and then the stamps, as they approach the porch. The men look cold, their skinny dogs fed-up. The only comfort I can offer\u2019s tea, brewed by burning tables and dried flowers. The piglet in my arms is fast asleep; and one by one, as dawn breaks with no news, each man returns for solace to his dreams: I watch the snow, and dream of San Diego, sizzling in the sun, and full of schnapps. \n￼Abstract Expressionism She had this huge dog - a mastiff, I think it was, that her father had bought her when the doctor said having a dog might help - and she walked very fast on her spindly legs beside him, trying to keep up; she\u2019d come up alongside him finally, and he\u2019d stare into her eyes like Wittgenstein. It was snowing - the sort of weather, the harbour-master said, one minute you were wishing you were dying, the next minute you were wishing that you weren\u2019t; and the girl with the big dog laughed, although she didn\u2019t understand him, and she was only wearing a cardigan, so she must have been terribly cold. Then the harbour-master invited her into his little office, \u2022 where two German tourists, looking very much at home, were painting the sea. Was it you who was saying, the bigger one said. Ad Reinhardt went all the way round the world and took 5000 photographs - or was it 50,000? - and not a single one of a human, not a single one! Her partner nodded, and gave the dog a sandwich, and then looked up at the owner, who got one too.

Her headless body zoill be rationed out, to certain people, people who are mobile, who\u2019ll move away, and build a new society, far from where the rooms are buckled metal, the beds are other people, or their limbs, and walking has to be conducted slowly, like walkingwithriosheetCfton w<irpPi). \n￼Crocuses And is her father with her on the lawn?

Her first gold crocuses were pushing up like fish (she wanted no-one to see them) between striped wasps on plums.. And what sham implement was he carrying: down with him? Scissors.
