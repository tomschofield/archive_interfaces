My shoulder-strap could be a wheatear turning a corner. The wind, through the cleat of my landing-net, makes the squeaking of many mice busying themselves under cover. On his ledge overlooking the loch the buzzard that is too big for a buzzard eyes everything stonily, then takes his pick. II Uist, a smashed mirror. I holiday here, to gather strength for the winter. So I fire my peats, gut trout, rub cold hands together: reassured that when December does come, I shall be far from here. Like all city dwellers. Ill I try to locate a tiny ratchet at my right ear, an insomniac cheese-grater somewhere beyond my toes. The place is hoaching with mice. They are in for the winter. Every so often we have an eyeball to eyeball confrontation. One way to dispose of them is to fire the thatch. A costly operation. IV Three days I have trudged after a pair of eagles; sighting them occasionally, overhead or on fence-stakes, surveying their land. This evening, 40 \n￼probing gobbets of fur, disgorged bone, I am perceived by a hind who stands sniffing, then bounds over the wire and effortlessly away. V Striding back from the Co-op, I clutch sodden groceries in a plastic bag one handle of which is sprung. Proud of the buffeting I\u2019m taking, I feel I belong: till I meet a chained mongrel, yip-yapping; and an old woman 'who slurches past, head down. VI The sky consists of strips of blue, like a holiday postcard. I sit writing, like a man writing a holiday postcard. The strips turn to steel, to smoky grey. The tide recedes, and recedes, all the way to Vallay. Meanwhile the multitudinous sandworms turn and turn. VII If, as the pundits say, new Ice Age does ^ (Cjbme, well I suppose Uist (@11 be as ready as most. The skuas sharp as razors; (5)he lochans, crystal., And in the long chambers, t3)he War Lords are sleeping still. & \n￼Museum Piece Through swing-doors, down stone stairs, along corridors crammed with items not on display: furred crates, shrouded warriors, glinting models of sailing vessels, curled pennant to bowsprit pure silver to emerge with a painting I\u2019d had framed iXno need toTpooTthread, becausesteered Nayji pallid guide with a security chit to the glare, who\u2019d think of it, of Glasgow sunlight. Kelvingrove half a lifetime away I still marvel (how our lives founder, heads bobbing in time\u2019s flotsam) at those galleons...sumptuous, subterranean. Carnyx Priest-mask, pig-snorkel, prow-peak glinting in its glass case? Chess-piece crafted for Cuchulainn; fossil sea-horse surfaced from centuries in peat-juice? Treasure more mysterious: a boar\u2019s-head wrought in bronze; mastery of palate and sprung wooden tongue passed down in secrecy, Pictish father to son. Such raucous resonance, from so slender a column of air, as struck terror into invaders. Fit too to proclaim, given occasion, a Nation\u2019s resurgence. cloe^ !2Un>Al in \n￼Conn Stolen 153-192 29/4/99 6:00 pm Page 185 Te Maori Plane-loads of numbered wooden crates delivered to the Metropolitan Museum for the Te Maori Exhibition, a run of near-disasters is ascribed to those whose spirits they contain signalling anger at being regarded as mere objets d \u2019art. After discussion behind the scenes, the opening ceremony goes smoothly. Then the discovery of severe notching in a jade head coincides with dispute over an extension of dates: the matter resolved, damage no longer seen. Where, given our ingrained materialism - the absence of green-stone carvings on our lawns, combs cut from bone \u2014 might the spirits of our ancestors reside? Up to us, to preserve our own repositories of intuition. 185 \n￼Outlook I study my hands on the keyboard, lined and bent as age takes its toll: no flames flicker at these fingertips. Yet seated in your garden, not idling but seeking \u201cinspiration\u201d, see bursting from the gnarled buddleia branches not just blooms but (this a crazy year for butterflies) emergent clouds of Painted Ladies. \n￼Conn Stolen 153-192 29/4/99 6:00 pm Page 187 Letters to Iain (for Iain Crichton Smith) I Dear Iain - nothing written for months, now a sudden inundation in response to your illness, a blur of hope and trepidation in the face of despair. How speak of death and dying in your presence \u2014surely there must always be hope? lr courage lets the bject be ot ached. From the bright crevass- of your pfrnd, warriors emerge: eacnwaver than the one before, though\\x>ner or later he will return on rvjs shield. T rm /to yourself and ofkers, 5ier dazzling, words prised like jewels from the air. I keep seeing two helmeted figures^ one in the throes of illness; the other his joyous likeness cavorting in space, like spun glass. JvrcTl ^ * i i in your presence - surely there must always be hope? True to yourself and others your courage lets the subject be broached. From the bright crevasses o f your mind, prising words like jewels from the air, warriors emerge each braver than the one before... sooner or later to return on his shield. pr / How speak ofdeath and dying /: \u2014 ' 187 y \n￼You saw the dark companion as \u2018the real poem alongside the actually created one\u2019. On my way to visit you, a doppel^anger in the train window becomes a ghostly imprint, against moor and sky. And I think of the circling fins of those other dark companions you have overcome. Now the worst wants to lock you in his foul, black armour. * Above all, may a miracle yet happen: a white, not a black sail appear over the horizon. II One of the men in your ward has his TV on: a big race from France; at Ibrox a game is about to begin. You turn drowsily, the still centre of your universe. The horses come under starter\u2019s orders, the rabid crowds roar. * Then Donalda arrives and your world changes. She is gentle, yet strong: so strong I\u2019m sure she could bend bars of iron. If she could have her way there would be no illness, no fear. No endless journeys, no wondering when you will be home again. \n￼-Q - She sits calmly, her eyes on you, your hand in hers. If anyone can make a miracle happen, she will. * And everywhere the nurses robust and rumbustious plastic bibs like fishtails who bathe and feed you. Now jocular now cajoling, they circumscribe your world. I wonder how they seem to you, those Kindly Ones. * The last time we saw you was at home in Taynuilt: you smiled and quizzed us. Now it is as though something had left you, rendered you defenceless. On the polished floor your slippers could be highlit by Vermeer. * Your Argyll slopes are tawny flanks flecked with light, the trees turning. You don\u2019t have these in your strange room: just those horses, the crowds baying.

Ill Thanks to you we see things differently, more acutely; love detectable, where we never thought to look. On the cover of your new book Tutankhamun from a golden throne gazes at his queen - she at him: a radiance spanning the ages, through the artist\u2019s vision and your own. Just out is a study not/STfffnucIiXff the divine king le manner of his death: x-rays showing blows to the skull. Your distinction lies in transcending these; tenderness preserved at whatever price: an audacious capturing of human trembling. IV The phone rings: the news we have been dreading. \u2018Iain died at twenty to five this morning.\u2019 Mercifully to the end the interchange of love through touch, and glance. Superseded by peace. 190 * \n￼-0- I think of whatever is Gaelic for sea-birds winging you home, your singing done. D eath\u2019s Corrievracken flexing its muscles just long enough to let you through. * Today I walk in the Botanies, simply to think about you, away from the ringing phone. Behind each tree-trunk, an invisible version of you; playing a game of hide-and-seek it seems, until the whistles blow and the keepers start shouting \u2018Closing time\u2019. Your voice on radio as if you were in the room, so natural, no hint of what was to come. In the old days the wireless used to crackle like dry leaves on the line. I imagine them falling, containing your shape, until the breeze breathes them to nothing. The programme ends with your favourite song about the white swan. Autumn fully your season. * Conn Stolen 153-192 29/4/99 6:00 pm Page 191 191 \n￼Conn Stolen 153-192 29/4/99 6:00 pm Page 192 I watch as a swan, its wings smirched by black stains, tries to preen itself clean. So words like death and dead tarnish you: how subdue them? From somewhere - the far shore or a recess of the mind - comes gliding, neck erect, all hauteur and grace, a swan of burnished ebony. 192 ","docTitle":"","docDate":"1999-04-29"},"meta":{"contentType":"text/raw","emVer":"7.1.1103.5","langIdVer":"DefaultLangId","processingVer":"CalaisJob01","submissionDate":"2014-07-01 09:50:29.511","submitterCode":"57b17a53-6e34-87b0-20ff-a419896f49c9","signature":"digestalg-1|sr+XuseS4ZjMUPxivRXwdYMIuIA=|OFBICTRVbyUM/KACpUbwuHmlF+2I6yQw9kQHow+Xwi0kzzt2m3BVCw==","language":"English"}},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/8f8c8c7b-152b-3e69-bef9-6b0a3b9fc76c/lid/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http://d.opencalais.com/lid/DefaultLangId/English"},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/58f5ed73-dcd0-3785-96ba-dfde9ae63514":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"City","name":"Glasgow","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/City","instances":[{"detection":"[chit to the glare, who\u2019d think of it, of ]Glasgow[ sunlight.
