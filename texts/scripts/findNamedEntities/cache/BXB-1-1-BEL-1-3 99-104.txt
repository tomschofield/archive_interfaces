He replied by reciting \u2018Ode to Dejection\u2019 In a basso voice that trembled. 5 He died by Walking off an Alp. 6 Once his pipe was burning his tongue. He made himself a hookah (narguile, hubble-bubble) From the two ends of it And a chemistry flask and rubber tubing. 7 Three things I still copy - His courteous use of \u2018Surely\u2019 - \u2018Well\u2019, to start an opinion asked for - And maniac cackle of laughter, crescendo. \n￼From~Hie Irregular Stanzas of Don Senilio (for Peter Redgrove) I \u2018It seems to me now a long time since I was excited about anything. I fill my insides with old man\u2019s bitter And feel sour besides. How frail I feel. And if I stammer now it\u2019s not young heat Baffled, but an inefficient cricket That never learned the use of its thin limbs To make proper sounds. Fric, fric, helas, fric, fric.\u2019 Thus Don Senilio scribbled a climacteric. II A leisure morning sits him at his window To watch grotesques outside. And he collects An old man puffing, Sellars in a bit part, An orange matron\u2019s parody of slacks. Those children are too loud. And a great Biscuit box of a lorry parks outside And he can\u2019t see, puts gramophone records on. A very old man might sit like this, Remembering Dan Leno, Marie Lloyd. III Does he feel the victim of Anyone in particular? He has friends in offices, offices, Less friends when they become Dispensers of patronage. Does he feel the victim of The man who has adapted, Become successful? Yes, he does. Has he adapted? Not enough, at his age. IV Fatigued, fatigued is Don Senilio. No longer can he summon elegance To whisper, \u2018You too, valetudinarian\u2019. The clear and saffron coucher de soleil 100 \n￼Is lacking which could silhouette Calligraphy of leaves in skeleton. He shuffles at the bus-stop in the fog, His feet begin to hurt, and he resents The unattractive others in the queue. V Senilio\u2019s regime can not afford Whipping by Venetian whores. He has to suffer at cut prices. Aches of decrepitude Suffice him. Sweats and twinges, Toothache, eyeache, hungover Late haste to work, short breath, Fear of the reaching crab. He keeps spry, the old boy, considering. VI Senilio is stirred by curves of neatly Trousered girls. But hair-styles bother him. Mountainous, maybe, not, alas, of Bath. , Sometimes he^things \u2018Rats\u2019 Nest\u2019, sometimes \u2018String\u2019. / Sometimes, from tops of buses, He awards marks for nubility From a possible total of twenty Instead of doing the crossword. He regards the young with lechery and dislike. VII Sitting with bad companions in a stews Senilio observed a veteran fall Drunk in the fireplace. In stupid malice He guessed, \u2018There goes poor Senilissimo.\u2019 It was indeed that potent senior Whose poems Senilio asked for as school prize, And asks forgiveness of his gracious shade, Envies his final slim volume. Timor Mortis Conturbat Senilio. VIII The cigarettes are smoking Don Senilio. He keeps on coughing. $ 101 \n￼The alcohol is drinking Don Senilio. His memory\u2019s going. He re-reads twenty pages of a novel He knew he wasn\u2019t enjoying. Paper piles up, piles up. He has had to change to bi-focals, Wakes at three every morning. IX It isn\u2019t work Senilio resents But going to work, Still having to go to work. We\u2019re all slaves here and some are ageing. It takes him longer fumbling coins for fare. The old gentleman should be granted Chauffeur, Scottish rugs, silver flask: He\u2019d bear down on the zebra crossings, Cackling as ushers scuttled. X Don Senilio Tips the parking meter A full half sovereign. Outside the Turkish Baths A constable salutes. He\u2019s awarded the Prix Lamartine, A Beethameer Fellowship, And a Life Peerage. Such seedy goods will keep him. XI It doesn\u2019t do to laugh at Don Senilio Unless he laughs first. He\u2019s in the business for laughs himself And likes to calculate applause. You mustn\u2019t think him Doctor Bartolo. He steals looks out of mirrors, Adjusts veined cheeks, grey hairs, And chooses a few words. He\u2019ll time the laughs himself. 102 \n￼Senilio\u2019s Distraction Song And patient monsters in the queue (The world can\u2019t last. I am too mad) Shuffle aboard the same bus too Sit paired in seats, the sad and sad I\u2019d boil them down to the same glue (The world won\u2019t last as I am mad). Here\u2019s absinthe. You\u2019d best booze it too (The world can\u2019t last for I\u2019m too mad) Illumination could flash blue To show what hopes are never had And I might say a thing or two (Before world ends. But I\u2019m too mad). Fair morning throws a milder hue (Too late. Won\u2019t last. And I\u2019m too mad) On people looking decent too But I\u2019m not going to say I\u2019m glad Too late for me\u2019s too late for you (And world must end now. I\u2019m too mad.) \n￼Senilio\u2019s Broadcast Script Riposte to Peter Porter Good evening. You know my voice. Instructions, now. Section leaders will break open Cabinet P.
