The hidden ships that ride at anchor in the river have swung to face the tide and all we see from shore are pin-prick illuminations on ship side after ship side where they stand off from harbour. Stillness imposes itself from the sky that water licks invisibly, deck-lights and stars unquiveringly mingled and alike. The Gulf swallows all distance, and lets darkness after darkness furl away. What can be seen delights by imperception, by the deceit in the whole dark-sparkling mirror. The world is doubled and inseparable.
