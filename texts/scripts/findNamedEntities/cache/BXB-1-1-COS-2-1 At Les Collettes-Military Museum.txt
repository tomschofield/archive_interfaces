In the hour before the house opens for the afternoon, stroll round the gardens, under those knotted olives, themselves a vast age before we came to occupy the place. Shade your eyes, as I had to, and look acrosst, the chasm of light between here and the ch»teau I** at Cagnes. Imagine me, being wheeled down these paths in my wooden chair, or sitting hunched over that day\u2019s canvas, in my open-air studio. Then enter the house, and experience its coolness. Go up (as I could not, latterly, unaided) to the atelier on the first floor, and look down as I constantly did, on the powdery green of the olive-trees. Consider them, if you care, with their gnarled contortions, a metaphor for my deformed hands\u2019 durability, through pain. Fortunately I had too much to keep me busy to worry about Cezanne and Matisse and the others changing the face of Art. As I gather turned out the case. I always kept to a sole design; whereas they saw from several vantage points, at once. Not only that, but they\u2019d detect prisms and angles, where I\u2019d see only smoothness. I sometimes wondered what chaos it could lead to - especially when that dark-eyed young fellow Picasso (born the year I did my Dejeuner des Canotiers) 56 L 'i & \n￼Conn 30/11/91 9:18 pm Page 57 came bounding, like a goat, on the scene, promising to go further even than their extremes; painting what he thinks, not what he sees. One clear reason why, rather than contemplate the future, I was happy to remain in the present. For all that I admit (in trust) to a desperation that once what is new has been superceded by the \u201cnew\u201d new, my early work, derided at the time, may be seen in'fairer-perspective; it be conceded I opened shufrers, let light in. Sleep comes over me. I have been too much in the sun. And begin to be overtaken by some kind of delirium. Purveyor of order, resident in this rectilinear mansion, so meticulously terraced, I see myself at times as comprising a geometry of my own: a sundial round whom revolve fragrances, subtleties of brightness and shade, which I transmute to canvas, in a process most easily attributed to sheer joie de vivre - if only to put the culture hounds off the scent. They could not comprehend, for instance, how Aline dictated her own style. Not least, through my delight in her rotundity: midway between fantasy and reality. More splendidly too, than with any other model, her skin responded to the light. Even that, now a secondary consideration. I miss her so much. Above all, the softness of her fingers, as she wound the bandages on. This, among my memories, the one thing that dulls the pain. I wish she were with me again. i I -©\u2022 ■e- / ' \n￼Conn 30/11/91 9:18 pm Page 58 Renoir in Orkney (fo r George Mackay Brown) Monet might have made himself at home among these flat, green islands like giant water lilies. Cezanne even, with cliff-faces all cones and cylinders. Not that my vision is impaired. More a narrowing of the spectrum to a harmony of glistening silk, as though too much light were being let in but without the embracing warmth to which I am accustomed: seascape and skyscape, a constant radiance. It would need the skin of the place to burst a blood vessel, or myself to stab at it with my palette knife: then there\u2019d be something I could express. Only this morning, the world disappeared; the boat I was in surrounded by quicksilver; the bordering land erased in mist. Like a composer frantic for some variation beyond a single high-pitched note sustained in his brain, I crave a cacophony of colour, before my mind disintegrates. At least with the fishermen I am at home. Their tanned features merit the mixing of pigments: my yellows and reds are in business again. As for the womenfolk, baiting the line has made their fingers like my own, and worse: knife-gashes, to the bone. Nudes are out. For one thing, their Kirk 58 \n￼-0 Conn 30/11/91 9:19 pin Page 59 0 concedes no such tradition. For another, contemplate the climate. But something in me burns. I must start again. I have found a girl with skin like mother-of-pearl; am working on still lives of lobsters; and will distribute at the solstice canvases of wild flowers, like mottled flame. 59 \n￼Conn 30/11/91 9:27 pm Page 60 Transformation It wasn\u2019t the Mediterranean, the yachts on the horizon, the bouillabaisse and cassis even which completed our transformation: the ultimate confirmation that tout va bien came, after un bon repas, in the rue Pourquoi-pas. 60 \n￼Conn 30/11/91 9:19 pm Page 61 Fort Napoleon We sit entranced in the night air, watching a troupe of eight actresses alternate as Alice. The dew so heavy they slither on the stage, till one goes barefoot, and the others follow suit. Finally they vanish, leaving only the moon\u2019s refractions, and a filigree of drenched prints, where they had been. / 61 \n￼Conn 30/11/91 9:19 pm Page 62 Military Museum Toulon basks below. A red box-kite strains at its wire, a cliche of aspiration, giving song to the wind. On the summit of le Faron is a military museum, complete with simulations of the Allied landings in World War Two. Coloured bulbs flicker on a cartographic screen, at each site taken. On stereo speakers, crackly bombers roar. So many souls lost, but how few their number when set against a nuclear future. Covering the walls of the tower, these framed photographs, medals for valour, letters of condolence, regimental colours, are like the outmoded weapons ambiguous reminders of values valiantly fought for. Consider their selflessness, the readiness to sacrifice themselves, that their children might inherit a land free from war. For us: how preserve the pride nationhood engenders yet encompass the call for wider loyalties, thereby surmounting the barriers between men\u2019s minds? Such power, to decree not only what is, but what will one day. Nor assurance as to the outcome of human struggle: witness the sacking of Troy by deceitful Greece, lots drawn for princess and queen; the murder of Agamemnon, restoration of the old order; the founding of Rome. No place for arrogance, in history\u2019s progress: down the centuries the classic flaw for consecutive conquerors, to think their rule pre-ordained, or God-given, who renege on their duty to their fellow men. 62 IL ","docTitle":"","docDate":"1991-11-30"},"meta":{"contentType":"text/raw","emVer":"7.1.1103.5","langIdVer":"DefaultLangId","processingVer":"CalaisJob01","submissionDate":"2014-07-01 09:49:41.608","submitterCode":"57b17a53-6e34-87b0-20ff-a419896f49c9","signature":"digestalg-1|5P908F0QwvRW7quMPI/tTWSTbEM=|Q1kRWbiHsnN5P9A+JbG6v2CFFV2PTG4n4Y2mEHAyUzXLV5P9hsjEDQ==","language":"English"}},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/23c9a989-7d78-36fd-9917-5cda1d66b81f/lid/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http://d.opencalais.com/lid/DefaultLangId/English"},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/40c873d0-c8e5-3bb7-8a3f-3ba034a00de4":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"Facility","name":"Fort Napoleon We","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/Facility","instances":[{"detection":"[ Pourquoi-pas. 60 \n￼Conn 30/11/91 9:19 pm Page 61 ]Fort Napoleon We[ sit entranced in the night air, watching a]","prefix":" Pourquoi-pas. 60 \n￼Conn 30/11/91 9:19 pm Page 61 ","exact":"Fort Napoleon We","suffix":" sit entranced in the night air, watching a","offset":4783,"length":16}],"relevance":0.103},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/08434796-22ad-3f7f-8eaf-7821af12ec22":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"Region","name":"Mediterranean","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/Region","instances":[{"detection":"[curve to Menton and beyond, under the broiling ]Mediterranean[ sun, leave the boulevard and climb by the]","prefix":"curve to Menton and beyond, under the broiling ","exact":"Mediterranean","suffix":" sun, leave the boulevard and climb by the","offset":192,"length":13},{"detection":"[9:27 pm Page 60 Transformation It wasn\u2019t the ]Mediterranean[, the yachts on the horizon, the bouillabaisse]","prefix":"9:27 pm Page 60 Transformation It wasn\u2019t the ","exact":"Mediterranean","suffix":", the yachts on the horizon, the bouillabaisse","offset":4541,"length":13}],"relevance":0.539},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/ebfbd3e9-f83e-3ac7-8ac5-2eeefd2dc4da":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"Position","name":"princess and queen","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/Position","instances":[{"detection":"[of Troy by deceitful Greece, lots drawn for ]princess and queen[; the murder of Agamemnon, restoration of the old]","prefix":"of Troy by deceitful Greece, lots drawn for ","exact":"princess and queen","suffix":"; the murder of Agamemnon, restoration of the old","offset":6218,"length":18}],"relevance":0.058},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/ef744fb4-a174-3aba-8eb7-b5eb3d2334af":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"Country","name":"Greece","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/Country","instances":[{"detection":"[witness the sacking of Troy by deceitful ]Greece[, lots drawn for princess and queen; the murder]","prefix":"witness the sacking of Troy by deceitful ","exact":"Greece","suffix":", lots drawn for princess and queen; the murder","offset":6195,"length":6}],"relevance":0.058,"resolutions":[{"id":"http://d.opencalais.com/er/geo/country/ralg-geo1/40bdb060-1848-7838-c520-ab7419d2accf","name":"Greece","latitude":"38.3228275976","longitude":"22.2591633135"}]},"http://d.opencalais.com/pershash-1/f74308f0-45bf-39a8-9702-c30d0a36b458":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"Person","name":"Serge Baudot","persontype":"N/A","nationality":"N/A","commonname":"Serge Baudot","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/Person","instances":[{"detection":"[30/11/91 9:18 pm Page 56 At Les Collettes (for ]Serge Baudot[) Scarcely any distance from the peopled plages]","prefix":"30/11/91 9:18 pm Page 56 At Les Collettes (for ","exact":"Serge Baudot","suffix":") Scarcely any distance from the peopled plages","offset":61,"length":12},{"detection":"[further even than their extremes; painting what ]he[ thinks, not what he sees.
