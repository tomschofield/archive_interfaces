One, that had dropped free, was frightened by a ground so fathomless; its wings flapped and its legs flopped uselessly. More fathomless to my vision was the place where they were hung up on the hooks that bare them swiftly onwards, upside-down in space; the cause I know not, but all as they hung there let fall a rain of excrement, whence came the gross miasma everyone must bear. How weak are words, and how unfit to frame my concept - which lags after what was shown so far, it flatters it to call it lame! And it might be ten thousand fowl or one went smoothly past the imperceptible electric impulse where they had begun their afterlife, wings fluttering the while; and even after they had been thrust through the cutter, headless they were fluttering still. But swiftly after that their power to move compassion vanished - as when, journeying far down through Inferno, one\u2019s own power to love Vanishes like the sun and the other stars. \n￼Menotti Menotti is sad because the World Cup has begun, sad because already they have fallen behind. Crouched round a wireless in their naked huts, hearing the frenzy mixed with mountain static, peasants believe in him, their terrible faith hunches his shoulders deeper than Atlas\u2019. Christ of the Andes knows he has no power to feed the hungry, or to make life bearable. A mountain as it moves behind the sun is not more motionless than Menotti. His face is the mountain looming out of mist almost touching the wing; and is the night-wind mixed with moaning in the fuselage; the steel that finds a home in a girl\u2019s breast. Blood pinks the snow nearby, but otherwise they\u2019re cupped in snowy white on white. Those yet alive cut into their friend\u2019s flesh with slivers of glass because of the body of Christ, who has ordained some to die that others stay alive. The wings! The wings! They\u2019re so quick on the break. Torocsik must be taken out. A cigarette smokes Menotti to the root. He\u2019s turning into ash. He\u2019s been living for this hour. Here, in the mountains, stars are moved by love. On the roof of the Andes, you can see it occur. You can see God using up his own body to move the stars. Menotti does not move a crevice of his stone face, for every time you move you use up a part of your own body. Though somehow they\u2019ve drawn level, he is still the death-mask. Buried in immeasurable snow, red nails peep out. They are cutting into her as they die, praying Our Lady for a miracle. And they crave stronger tastes, for man is bad. Send on Bertoni for one last assault. A centre dies to let a wing survive. \n￼Thomas 107-154 10/11/92 3:24 pm Page Q £ Resting, talking, in the hour before sunset, watching the peaks crimson, they are almost happy. You can almost touch God up here. Life is love. Menotti is sad because his team has drawn ahead. Above, two condors wheel. They are the first sign of spring. Descending on the last of their friends, and suddenly, round a gorge\u2019s bend, more beautiful than Mary, a patch of greenjKeep us on this height. Wanting to lose, moving the bright stars over the Andes, as men moved stones to Macchu Picchu. The ball\u2019s passed back again, possession football. Menotti\u2019s face is a tragic mask at the whistle, but moves like lightning, sending a smoke-cloud out, a sigh, embracing his weary and triumphant men. Cesar Menotti was manager o f the winning Argentine side in the 1978 World Cup. Other references are to a plane crash in the Andes in 1972, involving a Uruguayan rugby team and supporters. / 141 \n￼Thomas 107-154 10/11/92 3:25 pm Page Elegy for John Walter (Family-tomb, St Catherine\u2019s Church, near Wokingham) JOHN WALTER 1776-1847 ELIZABETH ANNE wife o fJohn Walter 1793-1815 (Dec. 29) MARY wife ofJohn Walter 1793-1875 JOHN WALTER 1818-#94 ft* CATHERINE MARY elder daughter of John & Mary Walter 1%1- 1> 142 Why, Jack! How goes it, my old chum? This wedding\u2019s got me down; I\u2019m glad To steal into your shade awhile Out of the flashy kodachrome. Steve\u2019s cheerful; and the girl\u2019s not bad. Off to Ibiza - not your style. Oh, your young wife, Elizabeth! Shrouded in her wedding-sheet. Child on the way, was there? Poor lamb. The Magi brought her torments, death, The cold churchyard. Sun-flushed Birgit\u2019s Been fitted with a diaphragm, Finding the pill had side-effects. O shit, you might have waited longer. And yet I\u2019m sure you put it right: With Mary ageing, loathing sex, Elizabeth grew ever younger; I\u2019ll bet you screwed her every night. You\u2019re a tough nut, young John in green! Came kicking through the broken water! The burden Liza died to bear; Then, all the joy and half the pain She left to Mary, like a daughter. Old lad, you\u2019re your own son and heir. Talking of daughters - Catherine Died just before your father, Jack. That did for him. She could not face The hoops of rectitude and sin (Sickening with a ramrod back), The hourglass narrowing of space. & \n￼Thomas 107-154 10/11/92 3:25 pm Page 19 / John & E.F. Walter 1845-70 Also your third bride, so to speak, Perished at her Whitsuntide, Leaving you, precious Jack, aged nine. Yet she might say, if she could speak, That she was happy to have died Before the ape-man\u2019s age began. Some say you died a hero\u2019s death, Saving your brother; others write That, stealing jewels from Sheba\u2019s Breasts, You fell in love, she took your breath - The sombre bride, the Shulamite, And in your heart her arrow rests. Here, we\u2019ve a dazed look, slightly grey, From listening to our Zulu spell - Cranmer\u2019s ritual, that nourished Your Flora through her long, rich day Until the twilight she timed well, When all the holy ikons perished. You scoffed the lot, Jack. What of that? But Hubert, lucky sod, tight-roped Between Hiroshima and Mons, Living discreedy off your fat. Had Freudian hang-ups, but he coped. What happened to your other sons? And what - especially - of John? What did the lad do with his life? Mortgaged the manor, took the loot? We only know the bird has flown; And Phyllis, your beloved wife, Distressed, sailed off in search, old fruit. We\u2019ve swathed into your peace, like rally-drivers, Clutching our road-maps, burning up your rides; Fearful that we shouldfind Leviathan We\u2019ve goggled round the murky wreck, like divers. Sleep well, John Walter, with your ivory brides. We shall not look upon your like again. 143 EMILY FRANCES wife ofJohn Walter 1824-54 JOHN BALSTON 13/ wife o f John Walter eldest son o f FLORA 1836-1917 HUBERT fourth son of John (S> Flora Walter 1870-1933 PHYLLIS beloved wife of John Walter 1876-1937 \n￼Thomas 107-154 10/11/92 3:25 pm Page For Doll Pentreath (The last native speaker o f Cornish; d.1777) With the doll she had mothered, with mother and father, with boys and maids, beasts and birds, curses and songs, in her crazy old head, herbs and flowers conferred day and night-long around her bed. All that she loved in their own tongue came home and stayed, and quiedy moved around, as a crone muttered and prayed in her simple words, dying alone. Cornish obeyed her, slowly, like the herds she had driven home. But the sea bled back to the whispered moor-grass and moorstone of her stone head. Nothing was heard. It was home, where nothing is said. 144 r ","docTitle":"","docDate":"1992-10-11"},"meta":{"contentType":"text/raw","emVer":"7.1.1103.5","langIdVer":"DefaultLangId","processingVer":"CalaisJob01","submissionDate":"2014-07-01 09:57:02.276","submitterCode":"57b17a53-6e34-87b0-20ff-a419896f49c9","signature":"digestalg-1|GB8DMcf11IMHMY+kNL7IXAiGcyM=|H7P5BOpFGECH/VtoGEjEyCCGNO5gLeobjgNoPW/U2Gr7gMF+eME//w==","language":"English"}},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/fdac1e3d-501e-305f-9dc9-20585912ad33/cat/1":{"_typeGroup":"topics","category":"http://d.opencalais.com/cat/Calais/HumanInterest","classifierName":"Calais","categoryName":"Human Interest","score":0.543},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/fdac1e3d-501e-305f-9dc9-20585912ad33/lid/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http://d.opencalais.com/lid/DefaultLangId/English"},"http://d.opencalais.com/pershash-1/69d88082-498f-3691-88bb-aefc046c2c94":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"Person","name":"Menotti Menotti","persontype":"N/A","nationality":"N/A","commonname":"Menotti Menotti","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/Person","instances":[{"detection":"[Vanishes like the sun and the other stars. \n￼]Menotti Menotti[ is sad because the World Cup has begun, sad]","prefix":"Vanishes like the sun and the other stars. \n￼","exact":"Menotti Menotti","suffix":" is sad because the World Cup has begun, sad","offset":1246,"length":15},{"detection":"[mixed with mountain static, peasants believe in ]him[, their terrible faith hunches his shoulders]","prefix":"mixed with mountain static, peasants believe in ","exact":"him","suffix":", their terrible faith hunches his shoulders","offset":1461,"length":3},{"detection":"[believe in him, their terrible faith hunches ]his[ shoulders deeper than Atlas\u2019.
