A history of secular Latin poetry in the middle ages. Oxford, 193^. A note on the spelling of my Latin texts, in which some inconsistency will be detected: in his anthology Dr Raby chose to present most of the poems in 'the familiar spelling of classical Latin', and in those cases where I have taken my texts from that volume i have let his spelling stand. The other poems, however, are in the original spelling of the medieval manuscripts; this differs from classical Latin in a number of details, the most obvious of which is that the diphthong 'ae' has disappeared and been replaced by 'e'. Medieval Latin also varies from author to author and according to the traditions of different periods. \n￼\"to -trim \\v THE VIP.GIN & THE NIGHTINGALE o \n￼PLuASt -jy\\VS fd UnivetoihjPress, Oxford Book of Contemporary New Zealand Poetry 1(0.U.P.j _____ 1 9 8 2 ) Selected Poems (Oxford University Press, 1983) Ci I 1 \\ HOE-MTSO* ( The Eye of the Hurricane (A.
