I ride there, borrow Derm\u2019s bike about twice a year & in some awkward phase Pm usually in I stand & talk to your headstone, not entirely convinced that you can hear me or that you ever do follow me around; watch me in my city high-rise stoned, articulate then giggling when Jo comes over & the sunset looms at Spital Tongues, or the nights when I chat up pretty English students in The Strawberry or when I just float about Eldon Square trying to explain just why the city has taught me endless fear, & let\u2019s say I\u2019ve had the odd fling, the odd transgression from the way you wanted me to be. I\u2019m not half as gentle as you were, nor as caring, but you can appreciate the world\u2019s changed! So I can\u2019t keep harking back to that night in 1975 when I sat in with you Cos Peg had to go to Bingo. You asked for tea & toast coated in Lyons Golden Syrup & it was almost as if you knew the score & felt like a last small indulgence, a taste of what was perfect. They came & took you to the coronary unit but I wasn\u2019t wakened & the cardiograph they did was clear but you had them outwitted. I was sent for in Geography & in the office Nurse Curry looked grave. I could replay the whole scene at random & have done & the last words I\u2019d written in the classroom were \u2018broken marriages\u2019 & Peg told me that my future plans should stay exacdy the same & I thought that was justice, I\u2019ve never regretted it. 76 A \n￼Cleary 53-80 13/7/93 7:06 pm Page 77 I\u2019ll never be completely English, I hope you must know that & I do strive to be as gentle & as considerate - at least when I blow it, get tainted by Black Bush & urges at least I agonise over it. So if you can hear me I\u2019d like it if you were always nearby watching. I\u2019ve never forgotten my brother\u2019s face when Peg went to tell him. He drew up in his Post van & she reached out to hug him. & how I saw how his face twisted, from up in the top room. That\u2019s imprinted oi^me wherever I go, this year Europe, next year The State, today the graveside at Islandmagee. 1k 57*7CS . I\u2019/m a few steps behind you, but I\u2019m catching up... 77 \n￼£ J Cleary 53-80 13/7/93 7:07 pm Page 78 Surrender Singing \u2018yigh yigh yippie the Pope\u2019s a fuckin Hippie\u2019 the loyal sons of Ulster used to gather in the shelter or hog the wall near the Chinkie knee-deep in Harp tins. They\u2019d conspire as against my will I\u2019d be drawn to them, to try & get to know what makes men in bomber jackets tick, how they see the whole shooting galllery, descendants of Planters with names like Billy or Crawford, never Seamus or Sean. I reckon the occupied are paranoid but so are these boys, long after Stormont & the B-Specials they all still see it I suppose as one long slow betrayal to London & Rome. The \u2018Free State\u2019 is far from free but they\u2019re indifferent. It\u2019s a dream they never wake from, a worse threat than Russians & remember that boycott agaisjntouying Guinness & Fig Rolls because they came from Dublin? It seems every 10 minutes another reverend appears & pounds away at platforms & there\u2019s never any faulting rhetoric if you\u2019re Orange. Sure, what about the Clyde Valley, Carson\u2019s old gunship? - they hauled it in glory to Carrick Harbour, then it rotted & it\u2019s all a bit primeviJ, I reckon, the uniforms & flutes, fasgow Rangers & hangovers, Red Hands & Ulster fries before the long march led by men with drums & fat bellies off to \u2018the field\u2019 & whatever te fuck happens there? How should I know? It\u2019s not a football match where neutrals go, & come to think of it I wasn\u2019t much interested in \u2018Our Holy Father\u2019 when he kissed the ground at Knock. I could live without uproar & though Westminster doesn\u2019t give a tuppenny fuck 78 e- \n￼Cleary 53-80 13/7/93 7:07 pm Page 79 they continue, it\u2019s their culture, well fair enough! But I can remember a flute band stopping outside our gate, they taunted Catholics by calling with their collection boxes & my mother said \u2018don\u2019t answer\u2019 & I said I wouldn\u2019t dare but I felt powerless & angry & bitter & frightened. Just say one of those jokers saw me with their mates in some bar? They might call me a Fenian Bastard, week me down by the hair, boots gettin stuck in, it happens on both sides I know, so when I get there, I\u2019ll stay, any place but here... 0 f 79 ","docTitle":"","docDate":"1993-07-13"},"meta":{"contentType":"text/raw","emVer":"7.1.1103.5","langIdVer":"DefaultLangId","processingVer":"CalaisJob01","submissionDate":"2014-07-01 08:36:25.492","submitterCode":"57b17a53-6e34-87b0-20ff-a419896f49c9","signature":"digestalg-1|p3dpeEVLu1+1ms52gltk7Kdlo14=|E01gzNNguCN3t2sjncHDPn3bDQV8NJtcIRFsuuf/zSiqd9JE0OmRvQ==","language":"English"}},"http://d.opencalais.com/dochash-1/b02e0d5c-e724-390a-a0a5-acf8ede46ea4/lid/DefaultLangId":{"_typeGroup":"language","language":"http://d.opencalais.com/lid/DefaultLangId/English"},"http://d.opencalais.com/genericHasher-1/238332b8-48d1-3998-bbee-166bbda31798":{"_typeGroup":"entities","_type":"IndustryTerm","name":"cement works","_typeReference":"http://s.opencalais.com/1/type/em/e/IndustryTerm","instances":[{"detection":"[Protestants & you all overlooking the knackered ]cement works[ over at Magheramourne.
