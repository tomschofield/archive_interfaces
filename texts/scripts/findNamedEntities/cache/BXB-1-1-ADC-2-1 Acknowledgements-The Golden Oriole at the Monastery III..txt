The heavens wheel about the earth with sun by day and stars at night; the rivers whisper sleepily, and singing birds express delight. ♦ The cooing turtle-dove is first; the heron follows with a squawk; the blackbird joins the chorus; next the swan contributes to their talk. Then sitting on a myrtle branch the nightingale instructs her young: Aow while the stars are bright, my dears, take lessons in your mother-tongue: copy my song; I want to hear the younger generation's notes in seemly hymns of praise to God emerging from your little throats. 4r We are a joyful tribe of birds, the Lord's musicians and his choir. So let him hear your instruments: make every tiny chest a lyre.

At this their audience expands, as all the creatures flock to hear: the little fox with bushy tail, the lioness, lynx, and fallow deer. Even the fishes leave the sea, and rivers find their flow reversed; the poet Codrus tears his hair, so full of envy he could burst. The eagle on a golden throne presides above his marshalled rows of peacocks dressed in jewelled gear, and companies of chatty crows, squadrons of kites, battalions of ravens, all exchanging views about the contest and its odds, keen that the nightingale should lose. But no: the ringdove has withdrawn, despairing of the victory; the cock and blackbird, ruptured both, can only squeak with misery. , The cricket-bird inflates her lungs and bursts with a pathetic pop. The nightingale, with staying-power to match her skill, comes out on top. ■# Dismay confounds the other birds; the eagle's face is almost pale: a ghastly chill invades his bones; his very heartbeat seems to fail. \n￼Praeco fugae fit ulula urgens gradi per abdita, pudore mens ne conscia poenas luat per saecula.
