She saw the spikes of his head, His brow, then his brazen face. So a£ter his swim & Leander's fingers appeared on Hero's sill And he hauled himself inside, naked and salt And grinning. She closed her eyes and let him feel Her open face, uncrossed her arms and felt Him warm her breasts and throat, thereupon a cock Crowed once, very red. And something came and stood Between her and the Sun, something cold, and ^LooR/ It moaned. And there, casting a shadow, naked 4 And bled white was the nailed man, he whose Blessing arms they fixed on a beam, and he crouched There gibbering of love and clutching his Thin shoulders and begging to be touched. #, He was encrusted above the eyes with blacky And maculed in the hands and feet and in his side, And through clacking teeth he begged her to touch him, and fLook?* He moaned, 'at this and this that they did^5 Showing the holes. Sun, the joker, though Had leapfrogged him, and more cocks crowed, And down the green hillside and through The waking garden the waters of irrigation flowed And plenteous happy birdsong from the air, As Sun diminished the ghosts of fruit trees on the grass And over the nailed man's shoulder stroked the harlot's hair And fingered open the purple sheaths of crocuses.

Caught fig-stealing girls departed that garden Q Only on payment of an equitable fine. 'Figs for figs,' he demanded, and the luscious part QOf girls, the cleft and honeyed, the conducive, The petalled-back, must cap his club.
